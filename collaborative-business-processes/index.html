				<blockquote>
  <p>Due to deep changes in technology, demographics, business, the economy, and the world, we are entering a new age where people participate in the economy like never before. The new participation has reached a tipping point where new forms of mass collaboration are changing how goods and services are invented, produced, marketed and distributed on a global basis. The change presents far-reaching opportunities for every company and for every person who gets connected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most business professionals have heard of the new buzz words Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0.  Initial definitions of these buzz words referred to new web technologies  such as RSS feeds,  wikis, blogs, social bookmarking, etc.) that became popular after the dot.com bust. These buzz  words also indicate an increased intensity of collaboration and co-creation among peers that is  revolutionizing the way companies and people interact. <br />
We are all used to collaborating with others within our work environments  think  meetings, shared network drives, emails back and forth). We also collaborate outside of the  workplace with people of similar interests  home owners associations, church groups,  volunteer organizations, parent-teacher associations). More recently, some of you may also  have collaborated with people whom you have never met  supply chain partners, various  forums, Yahoo! or google groups, Facebook). These different spheres of collaborations  Figure  1) basically happen inside organizations  team collaborations), between organizations  interG organizational collaborations), and within communities  mass collaborations).  </p>

<p>Team, Inter-organizational and mass collaborations are inherently different in purpose,  context, and behavior. Traditionally, the boundaries between these three types of  collaborations were clearly defined as well. However, new Web 2.0 technologies are blurring  the boundaries between these different types of collaborations. Consider, for example,  Research &amp; Development – most companies would look to the internal R&amp;D organization for  ideas on new product developments and improvements to existing products. Today, many <br />
firms  examples include Procter &amp; Gamble, 3M, NetFlix and GoldCorp) depend on open  collaborative communities  see for example, <a href="http://innocentive.com">http://innocentive.com</a> ) as well as internal R&amp;D  organizations to solve several vexing product development problems. <br />
In this module, we will explore technology enabled collaboration models in each of the  spheres of collaboration. We will discuss technologies, managerial issues and analysis  techniques that help us better understand how effective collaborative models can be created  and sustained. </p>

<h2 id="teamcollaborations">Team Collaborations</h2>

<h3 id="considerthefollowingscenarios">Consider the following scenarios:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Imagine you have just won a project from a prestigious client. The client is a big  pharmaceutical company with manufacturing facilities all around the globe. Your  project is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the client’s supply chain  management practices in the Latin American manufacturing facilities. Although you  have worked for over 10 years on various projects in the pharmaceutical industry,  you have never headed a project in the Latin American countries before. You believe  you need some members with previous Latin American project leadership  experience on your team. You think Charles Turner, whom you had worked with  two years ago on a project in Mexico, can help.   You call Charles and explain your needs to him. While Charles would have liked to  work with you, he is already committed for the next six months on other projects.  However, Charles connects you with Mike Crain, who is a perfect match for your  project. Charles sends an introductory email to Mike, and recommends that the  three of you get together to negotiate an arrangement that meets your and Mike’s  interests. At a subsequent meeting, not only does Mike agree to work on the project,  he also brings with him three other experts who bring valuable pharmaceutical  industry supply chain expertise to the project.  </p></li>
<li><p>Your CEO calls you up late in the evening on Tuesday, informs you of a business  opportunity, and asks you to prepare a proposal by Friday. Many of your trusted  colleagues are spread around the world at this time. You know you can count on  them to help, but you need some way to collaborate over email, IM, phone, or other  means to prepare the proposal. Many of the members on your team, who will be  needed to prepare the proposal, have not worked together before. You are worried  that different versions of the proposal will be flying around over the emails that will  make it hard for the team to collaborate. You also wonder whether they will have  the right chemistry to handle such a high pressure deadline in a matter of four days.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Situations like these are quite common in today’s global corporations. GeographicallyG dispersed teams are often formed in a matter of days; then the teams have to quickly learn  how to collaborate and contribute effectively towards the success of the project. While  traditionally members from a single organization would collaborate, today it is quite common  to see teams from different companies come together to design, develop, or market a product  or service. A more recent trend is also to have an “open source” approach, where any member  of the public can potentially contribute to the development of a product or idea.  </p>

<p>In these types of processes, collaboration, information exchange, and work culture play a  crucial role. The effectiveness of the process is dependent upon how well the team members  connect with each other and how the culture of collaboration is intrinsically absorbed by all  those who participate.  </p>

<p>The modeling approach outlined in the previous module has only a limited role to play in  these types of contexts. Therefore, we will explore emerging issues with respect to how  organizations are approaching the design of collaborative business processes and discuss how  existing business models are being radically changed as a result of the advances in  collaboration technologies. </p>

<h2 id="classifyingcollaborativework">Classifying Collaborative Work</h2>

<p>Researchers have attempted to classify collaborative tasks along many dimensions. The  main intent behind these classifications is to better understand how collaborative work can be  supported with technology. <br />
One way to classify collaborative tasks is based on time and space dimensions1. On the time  dimension, collaborations in teams may happen synchronously  e.g., a face-to-face  conversation) or collaboration may happen asynchronously  e.g., by email). On the space  dimension, all collaborators may be in the same location  e.g., in a meeting room) or at  different locations  e.g., via a conference call or webinar). </p>

<p>It is also important to consider what types of tasks are accomplished in teams. McGrath   1984)2 classified group tasks into four types in a framework called task!circumplex: Generative,  Choice, Negotiation, and Execution  see Figure 3). </p>

<ul>
<li>Generative tasks are creative tasks, including those that generate new ideas or new  plans.  </li>
<li>Choice tasks include problem solving tasks where there is a correct answer; and  decision-making tasks where a preferred answer is chosen. </li>
<li>Negotiation tasks are characterized by resolution of conflicts – for example, policy  formulations. 
￼2 McGrath, J. E.  1984). Groups: Interaction and performance. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.￼</li>
<li>Execution tasks that may be primarily physical  for example, construction jobs) and  those that are measured against some objective standards  most multi-step  workflow processes). </li>
</ul>

<p>Using this framework, it is also possible to see how interdependence between team  members manifests. For instance, Generation tasks benefit from close cooperation between  team members. Choice and Execute tasks benefit from increased levels of coordination  between team members. Negotiation  to an extent, Execution and Choice) tasks require  considerations for resolving conflicts. <br />
You will readily notice that we can place collaboration tools and technologies in the Time Space dimension as in Figure 4. Notice that some of the technologies under different  time/different place can also be used in the other quadrants. However, as we begin to focus  more on the types of tasks performed by groups, the question of task-technology fit becomes  more salient. For example, what types of collaboration technologies are good for coordination  intensive tasks? Are there collaboration technologies that help in generation or negotiation  tasks? These are harder questions to answer. <br />
In many cases, the organizational context and culture further complicate the use of  collaboration technologies. Verbal and non-verbal cues in collaborative activities are extremely  important for the team members as they convey valuable information and feedback in group activities. Collaboration technologies are inherently imperfect in conveying these visual cues.  Additionally, collaboration technologies can change the way group members interact. For  example, multiple members can simultaneously type their views in a chat room session;  however, in a face-to-face meeting, it is difficult for team members to simultaneously speak.  However, the multiple messages appearing in the chat room session can make it difficult for  users to follow the discussions. <br />
We will explore the task-technology fit in a bit more detail in the following section. </p>

<h2 id="fitbetweencollaborationtechnologiesandcollaborationtasks">Fit between Collaboration Technologies and Collaboration Tasks</h2>

<p>While the time-space dimension is a useful way to understand different types of  collaboration needs, the most common basis on which collaboration technologies are classified  is based on the type of task support they provide. Collaboration technologies and systems  provide three basic types of task support:</p>

<h3 id="communicationsupport">Communication Support</h3>

<p>Communication aspects of collaboration systems support, define,  and enhance the ability of group members to exchange information. Communication  capabilities may include group displays, simultaneous input, and anonymous  communications. </p>

<h3 id="processstructuring">Process Structuring</h3>

<p>Collaboration system-specific processes define the way groups interact  in group tasks. These capabilities include creation and enforcement of team agendas. </p>

<h3 id="informationprocessing">Information Processing</h3>

<p>Collaboration systems can structure, aggregate, and analyze the  information exchanged between team members. </p>

<p>Collaboration system features may cover some or all of these features – although, typically  they focus more deeply on one of the three aspects. For example, workflow systems provide  process structuring support; blogs provide communication support; and, group voting  systems provide information processing support. <br />
Bafoutsu and Mentzas  2002) review over 47 different commercial collaboration systems  and identify a number of different collaboration system capabilities4. In Table 1, the  collaboration system capabilities are organized by the task support they provide. <br />

￼￼ 
To define the appropriateness of a collaborative system, we consider the resulting impact  on group performance. However, group performance can be defined over several performance  dimensions – effectiveness, efficiency, perceived satisfaction with outcome and/or process, etc.  Still some preliminary prescriptions on how well collaboration systems fit a given task type  can be made.  </p>

<p>Idea generation tasks  refer to Figure 3) that are simple in nature  such as brainstorming  sessions) would benefit from better communication support as it facilitates rapid generation of  ideas from members dispersed over time and space dimensions. However, adding information  processing or process structuring features for these type of tasks can be counterproductive as  the focus is mainly on creating as many ideas as possible.  </p>

<p>Choice tasks that require team members to evaluate multiple available alternatives  e.g.,  investment decisions) against a single objective  such as ROI, profit, etc.) would benefit from  better information processing capabilities. Aggregation and summarization of information can  help reduce the information burden on the team members. Minimal communication support  would be needed in such contexts. </p>

<p>Execution and more complex choice tasks  with multiple competing objectives and  requiring the creation of unique solutions) would benefit from both information processing  and process structuring support. Software development and web page development teams  frequently use version and access control mechanisms to ensure that the created solutions are  well-coordinated. In these types of tasks, project management capabilities can enhance  coordination levels and overcome time and space constraints. <br />
Negotiation tasks that deal with conflicts in value and motivation can benefit from  information processing and communication support features of the collaboration system.  Voting, polling, and online surveys can help surface and resolve contentious issues during  team processes. Communication support would be essential to reduce the level of uncertainty  and mistrust among team members. However, any process-structuring support such as  agenda setting can be counterproductive as it might limit the free flow of communication  between team members. <br />
It should be remembered that the organizational and team culture influences how a  collaboration system is used. Therefore, it is important to consider both task-technology fit and  the social structures and culture within teams when implementing collaboration technologies. </p>

<h2 id="collaborationsystemsusageinorganizations">Collaboration Systems Usage in Organizations</h2>

<p>IBM, with over 300,000 employees worldwide, was one of the pioneers of collaboration  systems usage. IBM used several different tools to enhance knowledge and information  sharing, and collaborations across time and geographic boundaries. A tool called, TeamRooms   a Lotus Notes-based collaboration tool), was to enable employees to setup shared  collaborative spaces. Eventually, over 27,000 TeamRooms were active within IBM5. IBM also  operated periodic focused collaborative sessions on various topics. A recent collaboration  forum called Global InnovationJam was run over multiple days that had over 50,000  participants from around the world. These participants included IBM employees and their  family members in addition to IBM’s customers and business partners.  </p>

<p>Today, organizations can choose collaboration tools and technologies from multiple  vendors. Capabilities range from generic Enterprise level collaboration tools to process-specific  implementation of collaboration capabilities within industries and organizations. The wide  variety of tools does not actually reduce the risks of choosing the wrong strategy for  collaborative processes. In my opinion, it may distract managers from the real issues at hand  for designing effective collaborative structures within teams. </p>

<p>The years of experience with collaboration technologies within IBM has highlighted issues  related to adoption and effectiveness of these technologies6. Most importantly, collaboration  success depends on how well the team members adapt to a new way of working and not on  technology itself. Dorsett  2001) indicated three key contributors to success in IBM’s  collaboration systems usage as follows: <br />
5 Powers, V., “IBM’s KM Strategy,” KMWorld, 2006. <a href="http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/PrintArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16907">http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/PrintArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16907</a> 6 Dorsett, L., “A  Fast) Week in a Digital Collaboration Space,” Training &amp; Development, Vol. 55 Issue 1, p51-53, 2001. <br />
￼￼￼
• The Team Leader understood the leadership role in the new environment and the  importance of appropriate process for engagement in the TeamRoom. 
• The team members were trained in a face-to-face setting over a two-day workshop  to help them understand the team’s mission, the norms for information exchange,  and the process for making decisions inside the TeamRoom. 
• Before using the collaboration environment, the team members agreed on the  specifics of the new collaboration process. If agreement was not reached, the  collaboration environment was not used. 
Managers who work with geographically dispersed teams also agree on the importance of  face-to-face contact in the early phases of the group development process; additional face-to-face interaction can only foster social bonding amongst the team members. Additionally, the  incentives for using the collaborative environment should be set up-front. From a behavioral  standpoint, increased levels of transparency in collaboration systems can make some members  uncomfortable. This is because collaboration systems can readily track participation and  commitment levels of team members over time. The increased visibility and accountability of  team members need to be made explicit to the team at the beginning of the engagement with  the collaboration system. <br />
Team#Work#in#Organizations# <br />
Since our discussions so far have stressed the need to understand the context of  collaboration, it is instructive to review the types of teams we encounter in organizations.  Team leaders who understand the team context are better equipped to deal with them.  Sundstrom et al  1990) provide a typology of work teams which helps illustrate four major  types of teams7. </p>

<h3 id="adviceteams">Advice teams</h3>

<p>like committees, review panels, and advisory councils, are created to  broaden the information base for managerial decision-making. Advice teams require a low  degree of technical specialization and coordination and, depending on their purpose, can have  short or long life spans. Some of their typical outputs are decisions, suggestions, and  recommendations. These types of teams rarely need specialized collaboration systems, unless  the committee draws its membership from across different geographical or organizational  boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="productionteams">Production teams</h3>

<p>like assembly teams, data processing groups, and maintenance crews,  are responsible for performing day-to-day operations. While the minimal training required for  routine tasks calls for a low level of technical specialization, these teams do require a high  degree of coordination. Some typical outputs for these teams include components, assemblies,  and customer service. These types of teams benefit the most from coordination support  through workflow management and other similar applications. <br />
￼￼</p>

<h3 id="projectteams">Project teams</h3>

<p>like research groups, planning teams, engineering teams, and task forces,  require creative problem solving involving high degrees of specialized knowledge.  Coordination for these teams can range from low  traditional units) to high  crossGfunction  units). Examples of outputs are plans, designs, prototypes, and reports of findings. These types  of teams benefit from communication and coordination capabilities in the collaborative  system.  </p>

<h3 id="actionteams">Action teams</h3>

<p>like sports teams, negotiating teams, military squads, and entertainment  groups, involve high degrees of both technical specialization and coordination. In other words,  these are examples of brief performance events often repeated under new conditions. Typical  examples include combat missions, expeditions, and competitive events. These types of teams  benefit from collaboration systems that emphasize coordination and information processing  capabilities.  </p>

<p>It is also possible that teams can evolve from one type to another or can have components  of all four types. For example, project team composition and responsibilities can change  throughout the lifecycle of the project. </p>

<h2 id="modelingtechniquesforcollaborativeprocesses">Modeling Techniques for Collaborative Processes</h2>

<p>Several useful modeling approaches can be beneficial in collaborative process contexts. In the  following, two important modeling approaches are described. The first, Design Structure  Matrix, helps in appropriately designing a collaborative process based on the information  dependencies between the various sub-processes. The second, Social Network Analysis, helps  in addressing the deficiencies and strengths of a team’s social structure. </p>

<h2 id="designstructurematrixdsm">Design Structure Matrix (DSM)</h2>

<p>In iterative business processes, it is important to consider the sequencing of processes since the  processes can be highly interdependent. Note that the dependency here need not be from a  workflow perspective. For example, when one is designing a new product, the different  components in the product can be independently developed as long as the groups share the  design information with each other. However, if one group has to change the design  specifications, it can have cascading effects on rest of the product teams. Therefore, sequencing  the development of the different components based on dependencies can create efficiencies in  product development process. Similarly, in software development projects it is important to  sequence the development of software components such that the dependencies are optimally  accounted for and there is minimization of rework when software specifications are altered  during the development process. </p>

<p>Design Structure Matrix is a modeling approach that assists in optimally designing an iterative  process using dependency relationships between various sub-processes or components. The  dependencies are depicted in the matrix in different ways. One approach is to simply  represent whether any two components have dependencies in binary format  e.g., ‘1’  indicating dependency, and ‘0’ indicating no dependency; alternatively, ‘x’ indicating  dependency, and a blank indicating no dependency). It is also possible to show strength of dependency between components by using scaled entries  e.g., dependency strengths could be  shown on a scale of 1 to 10 with higher numbers indicating stronger dependency).  </p>

<p>DSM is a square matrix  i.e., same number of rows and columns) and the columns and rows  represent the components or sub-processes. Forward dependency is represented in entries  below!the!diagonal, and iteration  or feedback loop) is represented in entries above!the!diagonal.  We will use an example  see Table 2) related to Kodak’s design process adapted from Ulrich  and Eppinger  1999) to illustrate the modeling concept8. The different sub-processes here are  typical of a product design process. When reading a row, a ‘1’ in a cell  Row: I, Col: J),  indicates that the sub-process represented in row I receives input from the sub-process in  Column J. For example, activity, 3:Design Beta Widgets, is dependent on  or receives input  from) activities 1, 2 and 6. Reading Column 3 for the same activity indicates that it provides  input to Activities 4, 5, 6 and 7. <br />
￼￼ 
The entries above the diagonal in the matrix  marked in red) indicate feedback loops or  iterations. Iterations in iterative processes create rework and can delay the process cycle time.  For example, any rework due to feedback from “Test beta Widgets” to “Design Beta Widgets”  can cascade into additional work for sub-processes that are dependent on “Design Beta  Widgets.” Thus, it is important to  a) minimize feedback loops, and  b) minimize the  consequences of feedback loops on the process. When the above-diagonal entries are close to  the diagonal, the impact of feedback loops are minimized. It is also possible to combine subG processes  i.e., reorganize the teams for better collaboration) and reduce the impact of rework. <br />

￼DSM allows you to recognize some basic patterns in the process. For example, sub-processes 4  and 5 are independent. These two sub-processes therefore can begin in parallel. The same applies  to sub-processes 10 and 11, and 12 and 13. Sub-processes 1 and 2; 2 and 3; 5 and 6 are examples  of sequential configuration. The implication is that sub-process 2 can begin after sub-process 1  is completed; similarly, sub-process 3 begins after sub-process 2 is completed. Finally, some  sub-processes are coupled. For example, sub-processes 7 and 8; 8 and 9 are coupled subG processes. The coupled pattern is an indication that the two sub-processes need considerable  exchange of information. 
The benefit of modeling the process in DSM is that there are tools available to generate  alternative configurations to optimize the process. For example, using a DSM add-on in  Microsoft Excel, we can re-organize the above DSM  see Table 3). The reconfiguration is  termed “Partitioning the DSM.” The algorithm suggests that “Design Beta Widgets” and “Test  Beta Widgets” be closer to each other  perhaps through co-location or integrated team). The  colored boxes along the diagonal are also suggestions for sub-process integration. For  example, if sub-processes 7, 8 and 9 are integrated they would reduce the impact of the  dependencies between them. <br />
DSM tools can also suggest groups of tasks or processes that can execute in parallel through a  technique called “Banding.” Fewer bands in the process indicate that more tasks or subG processes can start in parallel. Note that feedback loops are generally not considered when  banding a DSM. <br />

<p>Organizations today have greatly reduced the layers of management in their organization  structure. One consequence of the flattened organization structure is that significant work is  accomplished in ad-hoc teams such as the ones mentioned above. Over time, interactions  through ad-hoc teams create informal networks among individuals who find it useful to  maintain professional and personal relationship with team members they have worked with  before. The scenarios described at the beginning of the module highlight the usefulness of such  informal networks. Increasingly, organizations are beginning to realize the potential of such  informal social!networks. These networks exist outside of the formal organization structure.  When informal social networks are utilized effectively, they can greatly increase  organizational flexibility and innovativeness. <br />
In this context, many organizations are realizing the importance of informal social  networks within and outside the firm. More importantly, when firms assess the structure of  the informal network, they can actually influence its growth and structure in specific ways to  reap greater benefits from the networks. However, analyzing informal social networks  requires the use of a technique called </p>

<h2 id="socialnetworkanalysis">Social Network Analysis</h2>

<p>We will briefly review the  concepts related to social network analysis next. </p>

<h3 id="socialnetworkanalysissna">Social Network Analysis (SNA)</h3>

<p>A social network is a representation of relationships between people or organizations.  Social networks can be shown either in the form of a network diagram or in a matrix form.  While the SNA method has been used in academic disciplines for many years, improved  computing power has enabled the modeling of large scale networks in recent years. SNA is a  popular analytic technique in public health, management, anthropology, biology and other  fields.</p>

<p>Social networks are built in a group context where information on relationships is obtained  by surveying the group members or by observing the communications patterns of the group  members  emails, meetings, previous engagements, etc.).  </p>

<p>To illustrate, let’s consider a group consisting of five members: Adam, Bryan, Cindy,  David, and Erin. The relationship between these members is shown in the form of a network  and a matrix in Figure 5 and Table 2. <br />
In the matrix  Table 4) we represent the existence of a relationship between two individuals  by placing a 1 in the corresponding row and column. If no relationship exists, a 0 is entered. It  is straightforward to move from the matrix form of the social network to the network form.  We represent each individual as a node in the network. A link is drawn between two nodes if a  1 exists in the cell corresponding to the two nodes in the matrix.  </p>

<p>￼￼￼￼The network shown in Figure 5 is bi-directional, i.e., there is symmetry in the relationship  between any two nodes. Social relationships need not always be symmetrical. For example,  when communication patterns are used to construct relationships, it might be possible that the  communication always happens in one direction  say, Adam writes to Bryan, but Bryan never  writes to Adam). Similarly, if we are capturing information through a survey and ask the  respondents to indicate who they would approach for advice, the resulting network is also not  likely to have symmetry. </p>

<p>To get acquainted with social networks you can visit one of the many web resources that  show examples of interesting social networks. One such site is <a href="http://www.theyrule.net/">http://www.theyrule.net/</a>. You  can build interactive social networks showing the connections between members of board of  directors of prominent US firms. These networks show how different US firms are linked to  each other through their board members. A sample network connecting some of the large U.S.  corporations is shown in Figure 6. </p>

<h3 id="socialnetworkmetrics">Social Network Metrics</h3>

<p>When large numbers of individuals are included in the network, the visualization of the  network structure may provide valuable insights. However, for a more thorough analysis,  different types of metrics may need to be computed. The following is a sample list of such  social network metrics. <br />
Degree'Centrality: Degree centrality simply measures the number of connections an  individual has with others in the network. Nodes with more connections have more options  for their communications needs. Degree centrality is often a measure of power and prestige  within the network. <br />
In Figure 5, Adam has a degree centrality of 2; Bryan has a degree centrality of 3. </p>

<p>Another approach to defining centrality in a network is to use the closeness!centrality  measure. One way to define closeness centrality is to find the number of connections that an  individual must go through to reach everyone else in the network. <br />
For each member represented Figure 5, the network requires at most two connections to  reach everyone else in the network.  </p>

<p>When you order the nodes in the network by the centrality measure, you will be able to  identify individuals or entities that are central to the relationships and communications within  the group.  </p>

<h3 id="networkdensity">Network Density</h3>

<p>Network density is the proportion of connections in a network relative  to the total number of connections possible  i.e., if every node is connected to every other  node). Density is a measure of how closely knit the group is. If the group has a high number of  connections, the group is likely to be more closely knit and collaborative. </p>

<h3 id="groupcohesion">Group Cohesion</h3>

<p>Cohesion in a group implies that there are multiple connections and paths  between actors. In a sense, network density is one measure of cohesion. When multiple paths  exists between nodes, the group is more resilient to loss of a node  for example, a team  member quits the firm) and communication between nodes is faster. Cohesion is also tied to  higher levels of trust and collaboration. <br />
Group cohesion  apart from network density) is measured using the average of the number  of connections for one node to reach another node in the network. The average over the entire  network gives a measure of the level of cohesion in the network. Group cohesion can be  applied to subsets of nodes within the network as well  to analyze the cohesiveness of cliques  within the teams).  </p>

<h3 id="coreperipheryandcliquestructures">Core periphery and Clique Structures</h3>

<p>Visualizing the network structures provides  valuable insights on the nature of cohesion and subgroups in teams. Two popular ways of  characterizing overall network structures are the corePperiphery and clique structures. </p>

<p>In a core-periphery structure, there is a set of nodes that are central to the network  i.e., a  larger number of connections) and a number of other nodes exist at the periphery of the network  i.e., fewer connections). The central nodes are the information brokers  i.e.,  communicate information to others). <br />
In a clique structure, a single core does not exist. Instead, a number of closely knit subP groups connect to each other and the sub-groups connect to other sub-groups through a  smaller number of connections. <br />
Figure 7 illustrates social networks with core-periphery and clique structures.  </p>

<p>￼Core-periphery structures have been noticed in some firms where the nodes in the  periphery were more likely to be top managers and the nodes in the core tended to be middle  level managers. This is not necessarily a good scenario as the senior managers may be out of  sync with their own organization. In such situations, interventions may be necessary to  introduce the top managers back into the core of the network.</p>

<p>Clique structures are more common in firms that have recently acquired new firms. The  informal networks of the old firms have been known to persist even in the new organization  despite changes to the formal organization structure. Again, specific interventions may be  necessary to break the cliques. </p>

<h3 id="collectingnetworkdata">Collecting Network Data</h3>

<p>Interestingly, basic information required to build social networks already exist in firms. To  build networks for SNA one can use the following sources of information: </p>

<ul>
<li>Email archives</li>
<li>Conference call records and meeting minutes </li>
<li>Documents produced in recent history by different teams in the firm</li>
<li>Expertise profile and previous assignments </li>
</ul>

<p>Analysts can use these sources of information to get initial insights on the type of networks  that exist within the firm. However, relationships are contextual in nature – we approach  different people for different needs. Therefore, employee surveys may be necessary to gain  insights on specific types of informal networks. Past research on SNA, especially in corporate  contexts, indicates that different types of informal networks may provide valuable information  to analysts and managers9,10: </p>

<h2 id="informationnetworks">Information Networks</h2>

<p>Individuals seek out and approach their colleagues for advice and  information. Survey questions can be designed to specifically seek out these types of  information-based relationships. Information networks reveal how well employees know each  other’s knowledge, skills, and abilities. <br />
Access'Networks:'Even when we know someone has the necessary skills or knowledge to  address the problems we face, they may not be readily accessible. Accessibility may be  hampered by geographic distance, organizational structure, or interpersonal relationships.  Access-related survey questions could probe accessibility of individuals within the  information network from the perspectives of timely availability, quality of interaction, and  engagement.  </p>

<h3 id="trustnetworks">Trust Networks</h3>

<p>When faced with really complex and sensitive issues, employees tend to  approach only those they fully trust for advice and problem-solving help. In essence, this  would be a network that the employee engages with in crisis situations. Naturally, Trust  networks tend to be smaller than Access networks.  </p>

<p>Clique structures are also more likely to show up in Trust and Access networks.  Information networks may be more likely to exhibit core-periphery structure.  </p>

<p>You may have already noticed that the type of information gathered in building social  networks is quite sensitive. It is usually advisable to engage an outside consulting firm to  explore the social networks with the assurance that collected data will not be shared with  others  including senior management) in detailed format. The discussions and deliberations should be based on the overall network structure  with identifying information removed) and  not on individual relationships.  </p>

<h2 id="technologyandorganizationalinterventions">Technology and Organizational Interventions</h2>

<p>Specific interventions to improve social relationships can be undertaken based on SNA  results. Technology and organizational interventions can be designed to improve the network  structure. </p>

<h3 id="cliquestructure">Clique Structure</h3>

<p>In cross-functional organizations, such as consulting firms,  employees bring different skill types and orientations. Social relations in these firms  can be fragmented leading to sub-groups within each functional area  technology  experts, strategy experts, marketing experts, etc.). Organizational measures that  bring together these disparate groups could include formation of cross-functional  teams and mixed incentive structures to promote collaboration. Increasing face-to- face interactions among the group members would have more impact before any  collaboration technology solution is considered. </p>

<h3 id="bottlenecks">Bottlenecks</h3>

<p>While core-periphery structure in a social network is desirable in  organizational contexts, it can lead to a few individuals becoming bottlenecks.  Information flow in the network can become too dependent on one or two  individuals. These individuals can become bogged down through their involvement  in multiple teams and meetings thus becoming a bottleneck for all collaborative  work. When such situations are encountered, specific managerial interventions will  be needed to reduce the load on the central individual s) to identify other employees  who can share the load in the social network.  </p>

<h3 id="sparseconnections">Sparse Connections</h3>

<p>Fewer connections  i.e., low density) in the network are not  conducive to smooth coordination in teams. To alleviate this problem, a firm could  consider technology solutions such as Corporate Yellow Pages  to improve the  information network) and corporate forums  to improve the access network). These  technology solutions can be augmented with managerial interventions such as  explicit incentives for participating in corporate forums and experts networks,  training and education to increase interpersonal trust, and corporate fairs and  symposia to foster new network connections.  </p>

<h3 id="lowlevelsofaccess">Low levels of Access</h3>

<p>Sparsely connected access networks may indicate a lack of  communication and information processing abilities in the networks. If employees  rely on synchronous media  such as phone and conference calls) for access, it might  considerably delay the ability of people to communicate with each other. If  synchronous media is augmented with asynchronous collaboration technologies  such as workflow systems, blogs and wikis, new channels of communication can  improve the access network. <br />
SNA can be especially useful in selecting influential executives for high-level positions,  identification of task group members for major organizational restructuring efforts, and postP merger activities. <br />
￼
We have focused so far on collaborations within the organizational boundaries. However,  as shown in the collaboration spheres of Figure 1, a large part of collaborative arrangements  happen across organizational boundaries with downstream and upstream business partners.  We will focus on inter-organizational collaborations in the following section.   </p>

<h2 id="interorganizationalcollaborations">Inter-organizational collaborations</h2>

<p>Traditionally, inter-organizational relationships were viewed from a “make or buy”  perspective. This transactional perspective envisioned an arms-length relationship with  partner organizations. Such a narrow view to inter-organizational relationships is no longer  valid. Today’s firms collaborate with partner firms at strategic, tactical, and transactional  levels. In fact, the term Organizational,Eco/systems is increasingly being used to indicate closely  interconnected community of organizations that collaborate through long-term relationships.  These new forms of collaborations can happen through several different arrangements –  strategic partnerships and alliances; long term supply contracts; outsourcing contracts; joint  investments and ventures; marketing alliances; etc. These collaborative partnerships are  intended to reduce risks, better utilize complementary assets, access new markets, and quicken  the pace of industry innovations. Given the use of complex technologies in today’s products  and services, no single firm may have the necessary technology or skill sets to introduce new  products and services at the pace required to maintain its competitive advantage. In this  context, inter-organizational collaborations are emerging as an attractive alternative to pool the  resources of multiple organizations.  </p>

<h2 id="collaborationmodels">Collaboration Models</h2>

<p>Any discussion of long term inter-organizational collaborations must require consideration  of sourcing strategies as well. Several different forms of sourcing strategies can be pursued. All  of these strategies embody the philosophy of reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and  reducing focus on processes that are tangential to the core competency of the firm.  </p>

<p>Several sourcing strategies can be pursued by firms. A sampling of these sourcing models  is listed in Table 5. Outsourcing has clearly evolved from a cost-reduction tactic to a strategic  tool. Given the vast number of options, the strategic decisions related to sourcing today are  about how to source each and every activity within the value chain. </p>

<p>As Friedman mentions in his book, The,World,is,Flat, a key enabler of the evolution of  sourcing models today is IT applications – especially workflow and collaboration applications.  Additionally, the increasing ability of firms to define business processes in standard ways is  enabling them to standardize processes across firms and industries. This naturally leads to  scale economies as individual service providers can build capabilities in specific processes and  provide those services to multiple firms across industries. UPS is a prime example of a firm  that specializes in logistics business processes. UPS provides specialized logistics support  processes for several companies across the world. For example, UPS can manage business  processes related to After Sales Support that include managing returns, supporting field  technicians, recycling, and repairs.  </p>

<p>The UPS After Sales Support Process is an example of Business Process Outsourcing  BPO).  BPO arrangements have exploded in recent years. While BPO started with outsourcing of call  center operations, it now has expanded to include knowledge-based processes such as product  design, marketing, and sales. Many operational processes require IT integration as well to  execute the outsourced business processes. Given the nascent nature of BPO contracts, it is  natural that many BPO arrangements have not been very successful. Among the reasons for  risks of failure include poor definition and understanding of the business process, poor  knowledge transfer, and high employee turnover.</p>

<p>Sourcing Models <br />
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Sourcing Models
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Outsourcing:
￼￼￼￼￼Contracting of services or processes to an outside firm that may otherwise be performed by in-house employees. Outsourcing entered the business lexicon in the ’80s. Outsourcing IT processes at large corporations such as Xerox and GE created the bandwagon effect. As the outsourcing practice has matured over the years, even smaller firms find outsourcing an attractive option for their IT services.
￼￼￼￼￼Offshoring: 
￼Offshoring refers to relocation of business processes, services, or production to another country. While China and India are the most prominent destinations for offshoring, other countries include Malaysia, Czech Republic, Singapore, Philippines, Brazil, Canada, and Poland. Offshoring may include creation of wholly- or partially-owned subsidiary business units as well as contractual arrangements. 
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Insourcing: 
￼￼￼Insourcing involves the use of outside employees  usually from a contracted firm) in services or production or development processes. These outside employees work within the premises of the firm and are under closer supervision of the internal management team. 
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Multisourcing: <br />
￼￼￼￼￼Cohen and Young  2006)12 define multisourcing as “the disciplined provisioning and blending of business and IT services from the optimal set of internal and external providers in the pursuit of business goals.” It advocates a strategic approach to sourcing that goes beyond individual outsourcing decisions. 
￼￼￼ </p>

<h2 id="keyenablersofcollaboration">Key Enablers of Collaboration</h2>

<p>Even when inter-organizational collaborations are conceived at the strategic level,  execution of the strategy determines the payoffs from the relationship. Toyota Corp. is one of  the pioneering companies to create knowledge-sharing networks in the auto industry. Toyota’s  collaboration processes with partner organizations have been extensively studied by industry analysts and academicians to understand the success of their collaboration model. The key  enablers of effective collaboration in the organizational ecosystems include: </p>

<h3 id="sharedpurpose">Shared Purpose</h3>

<p>The partners in the ecosystems should have the same sense of purpose  to openly share knowledge with other firms. This may require some of the larger  organizations within the network to subsidize initial participation to alleviate concerns  of the smaller partners about the utility of sharing their proprietary knowledge within  the network. <br />
Shared purpose in the Toyota network is created through: <br />
• The creation of a Supplier Association that acts as a community forum for social  interactions. 
• A network-level consulting division with the objective of fostering learning and  knowledge sharing among the partner firms. 
• Smaller voluntary groups of suppliers that share a closer set of objectives to improve  productivity and address quality problems. 
• Job rotations for employees of partner firms at the network level. </p>

<h3 id="rulesandnormsforparticipation">Rules and Norms for Participation</h3>

<p>One of the major problems in teams of individuals  or firms is that many may tend to “freePride” on other contributors. Collaboration  networks need to avoid this trap by creating rules and norms that protect the members  against free-riders. The network should not hesitate to remove partner organizations  that violate the norms of participation. <br />
Rules and norms in the Toyota network include: <br />
• Production processes within the Toyota network is not considered proprietary  knowledge. All members have open access to production-related processes and  technologies. 
• Only key product design details are considered proprietary knowledge of individual  firms. 
• Any value appropriated from knowledge transfer resides with the recipient for at  least 1P2 years, with the expectation that the network partners will share the benefits  after the initial period. <br />
3. Cohesive-and Dense Network: It is important to create a network structure that is  resilient in information transfer and collaboration. This means that multiple pathways  should exist between partner organizations. The redundancy of paths helps in rapid  transfer of knowledge. <br />
At Toyota, the networks established at multiple levels  supplier association, smaller  voluntary groups, and network level consulting division) facilitate the creation of a cohesive and dense social network within the ecosystem. The different types of  activities within these networks facilitate sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge. </p>

<h2 id="roleoftechnologyininterorganizationalcollaboration">Role of Technology in Inter-organizational Collaboration</h2>

<p>Technology can play a facilitating role in inter-organizational collaboration. At the same  time, technology implementation and usage in inter-organizational networks is fraught with  pitfalls and risks due to disparate technology platforms and organizational structures.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of collaboration process, collaborative systems can be used  extensively and integrated deeply into the business process or collaborative systems can be  used in a facilitating role for the main business process. Design processes benefit from deep  penetration of collaborative IT systems as these processes are iterative and involve highly  frequent inter-personal collaborations. While supply chain, manufacturing, and logistics  processes require close integration of transactional systems, they may also benefit from  collaborative capabilities that provide information processing and coordination support. These  capabilities enhance the effectiveness of the process integration at the operational levels  between firms.  </p>

<p>Boeing’s use of collaborative technologies to bring together partner firms in its product  design and production efforts is one illustration of the successful use of IT in collaborative ecoP systems14. Boeing uses Catia V5, CAD software from Dassault systems of Germany, to connect  hundreds of partner organizations. Boeing requires that all partner firms use the same  software and the same version for easy exchange of information. Boeing also requires that  every person  from any firm) involved in the design effort receive software updates at the  same time. These updates involve over 100 applications used in the design process. A data  warehouse for storing design and engineering information is also created. Partner firms  upload their design changes on a periodic basis so that the latest designs are available to the  entire team. </p>

<p>The standardized Collaborative,Planning,,Forecasting,and,Replenishment  CPFR) process in  retail supply chains is an instance illustrating how IT support for information processing is  helpful. Inventory management in the retail industry’s supply chains is a fairly complex  process. The uncertainties in customer demand faced by downstream partners get amplified as  the information is processed upstream in the supply chain. This causes each upstream partner  to carry higher levels of inventory  i.e., “safety stock”). Clearly, this is insufficient as the costs  of carrying excess inventory is eventually incurred by everyone involved. To help alleviate the  forecasting and planning problems in retail supply chains, the CPFR process lays out a  standard set of activities for supply chain collaborators  more details on the CPFR process is  available at: <a href="http://www.vics.org/committees/cpfr/">http://www.vics.org/committees/cpfr/</a> ). Managers in the supply chain have to  continuously collaborate and exchange information on plans, forecasts, store promotions,  orders, lead times, and deliveries. Typically, a retail store would have hundreds of store  locations, carry several hundred SKU  stock carrying units), and manage several distribution  centers and warehouses.  </p>

<p>Collaborative systems in such situations provide information processing support. For  example, an exception event  a new promotion) can cause a change in the order placement  plans of the retailer. In these cases, collaboration systems can help supply chain partners by  alerting them to misalignment in plans and forecasts. The exception alerts can focus the  collaborative efforts on the exception events and help reduce the information burden on the  managers. </p>

<p>The process change pitfalls we discussed in the first module apply in the implementation of  collaboration systems as well. In an inter-organizational context, the pitfall risks are elevated  due to the confluence of multiple organizations in the collaboration network. These pitfalls are  listed below.</p>

<p>• Resistance – Disagreements over the process change decisions and/or process design  that cause the process change effort to stall. 
• Inertia – Lack of progress on the process change effort despite  supposed)  agreement on the process design details. 
• Misspecification – Making incorrect process design decisions, creating a process or  technology that “works” but is a misfit. 
Once a new process design is rolled out, there is a danger that we encounter two  additional pitfalls: <br />
• Misuse – Improper employment of a new technology/process; in a sense, sabotaging  the process design through creation of informal and undocumented processes and  workarounds. 
• Nonuse'– Lack of adoption of the process or technology; this behavior especially  manifests when employees perceive the process or technology as discretionary. 
The following key points should be considered and agreed upon when implementing  collaborative technologies in inter-organizational contexts: <br />
• Is their prior agreement on the use of the system among partner organizations? 
• Do all members have access to the same version of the technology platform? 
• Who is responsible for providing training and support? 
• How are the costs of implementing and maintaining the system shared across  partner organizations? 
• If disputes arise in the use and performance of the system, what is the process used  for resolving the disputes? 
• Who retains data ownership in the collaboration system? If it is shared, what are the  standards for use and dissemination of information? 
• If the system can have widespread use in the industry, can the process and  technology features be adopted as an industry standard  much like CPFR)?  </p>

<h2 id="examplesofinnovativecollaborationmodels">Examples of Innovative Collaboration Models</h2>

<p>Collaborations between firms need not always be based on technology integration or  technology usage. A few such examples of innovative collaborations are discussed below. <br />
Netbank was an Internet-only bank that had no physical branches  unfortunately, this bank  went bankrupt in 2007 in the wake of the mortgage crisis)15. Most of its retail customers had to  use pre-paid envelopes to deposit checks. The cycle time to complete the deposit transactions  used to be around 7 days. The process was also expensive for NetBank as it paid for postage  and envelope costs. While using ATMs from other banks was an option, it would have been  cost0-prohibitive for NetBank to refund transaction charges to its customers for deposits.  NetBank also considered the other costly option of investing in a network of ATM machines.  In looking for ideal locations to put the teller machines, it began talking to UPS. UPS had a  network of over 3500 retail stores across America. However, it was not interested in hosting  ATMs in its retail stores. Eventually, the two firms came up with an interesting solution: Bank  customers could go to any UPS store and drop their deposit envelopes and obtain a receipt.  The UPS store, at the end of the day, would consolidate all the envelopes and overnight it to  NetBank’s processing center. The arrangement benefited both UPS and NetBank. NetBank  could process deposits in two days instead of the normal seven days. UPS would also benefit  from the increased foot-traffic to its retail store. This arrangement needed no IT integration or  collaboration technologies!  </p>

<p>The Chinese motorcycle industry is an example of successful modularization of product  development and production16. The Chinese motorcycle industry is concentrated in the city of  Chongqing. The industry consists of several hundred loosely coupled firms that coordinate to  design and produce motorcycles and motorcycle components. The firms involved in the  network collaboratively modify the specifications to make rapid improvements in product  design. Since the firms are co-located in the same city, there are ample opportunities for faceP to-face interactions for testing out the design ideas. These loosely-coupled collaborations in the  industry have been spectacularly successful. Chinese-manufactured motorcycle sales have  grown from 5 million in 1997 to over 21 million in 2006. <br />
As technology takes center stage with the widespread acceptance of e-business, it is  increasingly the case that IT standards become both a facilitator and, in some cases, the very  subject of e-business. In today’s business environment the need for developing widelyP accepted rules of engagement or standards for technology is principally to facilitate  interoperability among information products and services. However, standards-setting  processes involve interactions between firms with often conflicting objectives. In addition,  standards-setting processes are massive collaboration efforts – in all over 520 organizations  have been identified by XML.ORG, an independent industry group that keeps track of  ongoing XML standardization efforts. As active players attempt to influence XML-based eP business standards for specific industries and in the cross industry contexts, the group of firms engaged in creating and promoting standards use a variety of media to collaborate and resolve  conflicts. Collaboration processes include participation in industry consortia, face-to-face  meetings and teleconferences, and online discussion groups. A close examination of the social  networks formed in the standards bodies reveals a robust community of subject matter experts  who have built lasting social networks. These experts often share a common vision for the  evolution of the e-business industry and associated technologies. </p>

<h2 id="masscollaboration">MassCollaboration</h2>

<p>Mass collaboration is a logical extension of inter-personal and inter-organizational  collaborations. It is perhaps the most exciting new development in recent years – it has lifted  the gloomy mood in the IT industry with some exciting prospects for increasing the customer  experience.  </p>

<p>Interactions in a mass collaboration setting are termed as peer/to/peer. Basically, the  communities formed through mass collaborations are forums for individuals to interact with  each other. In most cases, these individuals do not belong to any specific entities or  organizations. New Web 2.0 technologies have been instrumental in creating these  communities. In Table 6, a number of prominent mass collaboration environments and  communities are listed.  </p>

<p>￼￼￼The emerging mass collaboration models pose a number of intriguing questions and issues  that have both business and societal implications. We will explore these and the following  issues in this section: </p>

<ol>
<li>Given the lack of explicit incentives at the outset, it appears that mass collaboration  environments would be hard pressed to survive and sustain. Surprisingly, these  environments not only have shown resiliency, they have also grown at a spectacular rate in the past few years. We will explore the underlying phenomenon of mass  collaboration communities.  </li>
<li>A number of firms have begun to exploit the untapped potential of open communities.  How do they do it? And what are the ramifications?  </li>
<li>A number of firms have begun to embark on building internal communities modeled  upon Web 2.0 mass collaborations. Can these so-called “Enterprise 2.0” initiatives thrive  inside corporate walls?  </li>
<li>A number of firms have begun to create customer-facing communities to provide  resources pertaining to product knowledge and after-sales issues. Both employees and  knowledgeable customers participate as “experts” in these forums. Can these  communities sustain? What are the prerequisites to running such corporate focused  communities? </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sustainingandgrowingpeercommunities">Sustaining and Growing Peer Communities</h3>

<p>In the ’90s, Internet usage grew rapidly as the number of servers and clients connected to it  exponentially increased. Interestingly, none of the growth was really planned – we “selfP organized” into a massive community for information-sharing within a short amount of time.  In a similar way, peer communities for mass collaborations are “self-organizing.” This would  imply that mass collaboration is inherently a messy and random process. This indeed was the  initial thought-process related to Internet growth. <br />
More recently, however, we are beginning to unearth patterns in how the Internet has  inherently self-organized in a systematic fashion  at least from the perspective of the  connections between web pages). Among the earliest works, Barabasi and Albert  1999)  showed that the pattern of connectivity between pages on the WWW follows a power-law  distribution17. If one were to go with the initial assumption that the pages are connected to  each other in a random fashion, then the distribution of the number of connections per page  should be even  i.e., each page is equally likely to be connected to any other page). However,  what really emerged is that a very small percentage of the pages had a very large number of  connections and a very large percentage of the pages had very few connections. This follows  what is called a power law distribution  see Figure 8).</p>

<p>What this implies is that as the WWW grew, the new pages were likely to be designed in  such a way that they linked to pages which already had a large number of connections.  Interestingly, this is how many social networks behave. People desire to create connections  with those who already are well-connected. A side benefit is that the number of links that we  must go through to reach a random node can be reduced considerably. This is why human  networks are termed “small-world networks.” It takes an incredibly small number of links to  connect one person to any random person in the country! </p>

<p>￼￼ 
Many social networking sites try to take advantage of this phenomenon. For example,  LinkedIn can build a remarkably close-knit community through their social networking  model. The effectiveness of the network grows as the number of people who signPin grows as  well. </p>

<p>So, how does the “small-world network” connect to mass collaboration communities? It  turns out that even content contributions and subscriptions follow the “small-world” pattern.  For example, the contribution to readership ratio on Wikipedia is very low, i.e., a very small  percentage of users contribute and a very large percentage of readers benefit! According to  Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, 10 percent of all users make 80  of all edits; 5 percent of all  users make 66  of edits; half of all edits are made by just 2 1⁄2  of all users. So, power-law  distribution still rules.  </p>

<p>A low threshold level of contribution creates additional incentives for participants. For  example, in open source software development communities, users can contribute by either  submitting code changes or by contributing bug reports. A very small percentage of users  contribute to code changes because of the high threshold level  aka scale-free pattern).  However, a larger percentage of users report bugs because of the low threshold level for  contribution. <br />
Similarly, on social bookmarking sites, there is a low threshold level for participation – you  simply need to contribute a bookmark. On Wikipedia, there is a lower level threshold for  doing minor edits  for example, correcting spelling mistakes, adding a sentence or two to  complete the article). Therefore, a larger number of contributors are seen to play the role of “editors” and “synthesizers,” a smaller number of contributors actually need to create “new”  articles.  </p>

<p>So, for a collaborative community to be successful, it is important to have a large user base.  Even if a small number of these users are contributors, the community can be sustainable. The  long tail in the power law distribution is the “lurker” population – but it is an integral part of  the community as it keeps the community vibrant. Without this community, the small set of  contributors could get discouraged. If possible, a low threshold level for participation is  desirable. If not, the community should be set up to allow for multiple levels of participation  so that contributors can self-organize at the levels they are willing to participate. </p>

<h3 id="crowdsourcing">Crowd sourcing</h3>

<p>The Open Source Software  OSS) community is a peculiar phenomenon. It is a seemingly  unrelated set of people who may have never met, gathering in digital space to build fairly  complex software products  including operating systems, browsers, and server applications).  Commercially-equivalent products of this nature are built by corporations that employ  hundreds of highly-paid programmers and systems architects and spend millions of dollars in  design and development. <br />
While the open source movement creates a number of interesting societal questions on  intellectual property rights, it also brings forth the vast potential and abilities of self-organized,  openPended communities to carry out intellectually-complex projects. Many firms have begun  to utilize open source communities and even encourage their employees to contribute and  participate in creating new products. Firms like IBM and Redhat generate revenue from  providing complementary services and support for open source products. Interestingly, the  open source model is being extended in unexpected ways by some firms in other industries.  Jeff Howe  <a href="http://crowdsourcing.com">http://crowdsourcing.com</a>) defines crowd sourcing as “nthe act of taking a job  traditionally performed by a designated agent  usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an  undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call.n Or “the application of  Open Source principles to fields outside of software.” A sampling of crowd sourcing  approaches used by NetFlix, Innocentive.com, Rentacoder.com, and GoldCorp are an indicator  of the future of collaboration in corporate settings. <br />
• NetFlix, an online, DVD rental company that has challenged the statusPquo of the  storePbased DVD rental business dominated by Blockbuster. At the heart of  NetFlix’s business strategy is its ability to predict whether a customer would like or  not like a movie. The Cinematch recommendation system that NetFlix uses mines  millions of movie rentals to come up with accurate predictions. Obviously, NetFlix  wants these predictions to be as accurate as possible. While it continues to work on  improving its prediction algorithm, it also threw a challenge in 2006 to the outside  world to improve upon the prediction accuracy. The “NetFlix Prize”   <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/index">http://www.netflixprize.com/index</a>) promised to award $1 Million to anyone who  improved the prediction accuracy by at least 10  over Cinematch’s current  capabilities. It provided a training dataset of actual movie rentals from its data warehouse for contestants to test their algorithm. At the beginning of 2008, there  were 30,056 registered contestants on 24,000 teams from 167 different countries.  Over 20,000 valid submissions were received from 2876 different teams. These teams  were been able to improve upon prediction accuracy by over 8   as against the goal  for grand prize – 10 ). NetFlix also awarded $50,000 for a team that was first to  reach a target rate of accuracy set for the year. The winning team for the $1 million  prize was a group of employees from AT&amp;T Research Labs! 
• Innocentive.com is an open innovation community that won the Economist  magazine’s “Business Process Award.” Innocentive.com has created a marketplace  for firms to expand their R&amp;D capabilities by reaching out to a vast network of  researchers and experts all around the world. As an intermediary, Innocentive.com  manages the intellectual property transfer issues for the solvers and seeking firms.  Firms that announce a challenge associate an award amount for the solver. The firm  can select from a set of solutions provided by the solvers that best meets its  requirements. Interestingly, the firm does not have to pay for failed attempts at  solutions. Over 125,000 solvers are registered on Innocentive.com from highly  scientific and specialized fields such as chemistry, life sciences, and physical  sciences. Several major companies including Boeing, Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly and  Company, and Procter &amp; Gamble post challenges regularly on Innocentive.com. <br />
• Rentacoder.com is the ebay equivalent of software programming services.  Rentacoder.com allows buyers to post programming problems or systems  development project requests online. Nearly 200,000 registered programmers on the  site can bid for these projects. As in ebay, programmers and buyers build reputation  scores over time. Buyers can place their requests for free and once they accept a bid  can place the negotiated amount in an escrow account. The programmer will get  paid once they complete the systems development. Most of the requests are for  projects that would be too small to be contracted to outsourcing companies. Many of  the programmers are from low-cost countries. To maintain a sustainable community  of programmers and buyers, Rentacoder.com publishes top programmer lists and  Expert Guarantee features  aka a certification program). <br />
Rentacoder.com is not without competition. Topcoder.com is another firm that uses  the crowd sourcing strategy with a different twist. Topcoder.com uses weekly  competitions to rate its base of thousands of software developers around the world.  Only those who qualify are eligible for working on projects. Topcoder.com uses a  specialized methodology to build software by drawing from the army of qualified  developers around the world. Each project is divided into smaller parts and opened  up as a competition for its developer community. The best solution is selected from  the pool of solutions provided by the developers. Topcoder.com then assembles the  final project by integrating the different components together. <br />
• GoldCorp is a Canadian Gold Mining Corporation. Goldcorp in 1999 faced a tough  problem – its 50PyearPold mine in Red Lake, Ontario was facing high costs and  depleting gold deposits. While some test drilling at remote sites revealed possibly  rich deposits of gold, the firm’s geologists were unable to accurately estimate the  amount of gold deposits and the exact locations. The CEO of GoldCorp CEO at that  time, Rob McEwen, surprised everyone by releasing the geological data to the entire  world under the “GoldCorp Challenge”  <a href="http://www.goldcorpchallenge.com/">http://www.goldcorpchallenge.com/</a>).  Several submissions came in from around the world that identified over a 100 areas  for possible exploration. A substantial number of the identified areas yielded gold.  Between 2000 and 2001, gold production increased by nearly 500  in the Red Lake  area. The top four finalists in the competition were awarded $325,000. <br />
While these success stories point to the advantages of crowd sourcing, there are also  troubling issues that managers have to be aware of when embarking on this business model.  First, there is an element of exploitation that one has to carefully address. The competitions  may appear to exploit individuals’ time and effort, especially when the competition reward  and resulting benefits to the firm are not well-matched. Second, as more firms follow the  crowd sourcing model, the novelty of the approach may wear out and thus may possibly  diminish the quality of the final solutions. Finally, when customer data is released, firms may  inadvertently breach privacy rules and standards. For example, when AOL released its  customer search queries database, it inadvertently revealed embarrassing details about  individual customers  not surprisingly, search patterns over time by the same customer  reveals a lot about that customer – a customer may use his/her own name and address as a  search term at some point in time and he/she also may search for information on medical  conditions. When these different search queries are combined, a profile of that customer with a  rich set of personal information can be created.). Even when customer data is not involved,  other data released as part of the competition may contain sensitive corporate data that can be  exploited by competing firms.  </p>

<h3 id="enterprise20">Enterprise 2.0</h3>

<p>Many firms have begun to use mass collaboration technologies and processes internally.  Some have begun to use the term Enterprise'2.0 to refer to a new set of collaborative processes  and technologies adapted from the more popularlyPused Web 2.0 collaboration technologies.  These technologies include instant messaging, blogs, and wikis.  </p>

<p>At the outset, mass collaboration internal to the organization requires a change in mindset.  It is hard to imagine the entire organization collaborating on projects in a self-organized  manner. So how exactly can mass collaboration be achieved? We mentioned that the power  law distribution is one of the underlying reasons that a large base of users can self-organize to  peer-produce content. However, corporate divisions do not have a large base of employees.  They are also governed by a different set of norms and practices. Corporate employees have  accountability – their contributions would be judged more closely by their managers and  peers. While peer producers can self-organize and do not have any internal deadlines to work with, corporate employees constantly juggle with multiple responsibilities and deadlines.  Therefore it is not easy to assume that mass collaboration processes and technologies can be  easily adapted inside corporate settings. Any implementation of Web 2.0 technologies and  processes should justify the investments in time and money. <br />
Some examples of mass collaboration tools inside corporations have begun to emerge.  These early efforts show promising new ways through which new forms of collaboration  models can be defined inside the organization. <br />
• The'Geek'Squad division within Best Buy generates over $1 billion in revenues  through customized computer services for individual consumers in the US. The  computer services personnel in Geek Squad use many different types of  collaboration tools. Given that these personnel are technology savvy, their methods  of collaboration are unique. As the division grew from 60 to over 10,000 employees,  Geek Squad members used online games such as Battlefield 2 to stay in touch. While  playing games, these members exchanged valuable tips and tricks related to their  work18. At the same time, a corporate-sponsored wiki system was very slow to take  off within the organization. The success of the selfP-rganized network in Geek  Squad has encouraged Best Buy to try new forms of bottomPup collaborations in its  retail division through initiatives such as leadership forums that gather customer  insights from frontline employees. <br />
• DrKW  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein) is an investment bank based in London.  The bank has experimented extensively with wikis and blogs in its internal  processes19. While the initial use of wikis and blogs began in the IT division, it has  been slowly expanded to include the bank’s main business divisions as well. The IT  division uses wikis mainly to manage meeting minutes, document procedures and  how-tos, and create presentations. The firm has found that it is important to create  some initial content to guide users in the beginning and then let the employees selfP organize the content in their own way through an adaptive process. Over 2500  employees use the wikis and blogs regularly. Interestingly, to promote widespread  use of blogs, the firm included a link to the employee blogs inside the Outlook  contact information in the same way that phone and fax numbers are included. <br />
• Angel.com is a subsidiary of MicroStrategy that provides interactive voice response  and call center solutions. Angel.com used wikis initially to handle project  management-related collaborations. The use spread slowly to other divisions  including marketing and operations staff. For instance, marketing groups used wikis  to share market research information; operations staff used wikis to share product  upgrade schedules.
￼￼
A survey of Web 2.0 usage in corporations discovered the following processes that  benefited from the use of Web 2.0 based processes20: <br />
• Software Development 
• E-learning 
• Project Management 
• Posting general Information  • User Groups 
• Ad-hoc Collaboration  • Tech Support 
• Resource Management  • R&amp;D 
As with Web 2.0 usage in consumer-oriented websites, different levels of participation have  been observed in this survey. As shown in Figure 9, the survey by Majchrzak et al.,  2006)  identifies user participation at different levels of contribution intensity. <br />
￼
For sustained use of Web 2.0 tools inside the corporation one would therefore need clear  incentives for participation. Engaging users in time-constrained project management situations  actually creates a setting where incentives to participate in the collaborative environment is  high. In these settings, we would not necessarily see the manifestation of power-law  distribution, and yet see a successful collaboration effort. However, when Web 2.0 is used in  settings where there are no explicit time constraints  such as for tech support, R&amp;D, and adP hoc collaborations), larger groups will have a higher likelihood of successful implementation  of Web 2.0 collaboration tools. </p>

<p>Fostering'Customer:Facing'Communities' <br />
Corporations have begun to utilize Web 2.0 technologies to create and foster customer  communities. If utilized well, these communities can be great customer-retention mechanisms.  The spirit of the approach is captured well by a recent post by Dell Corporation on its website: <br />
Customers helping customers is something that we encourage at Dell and wikis are one of the ways we're pursuing that goal. We will be launching our first customer-facing wiki later this month, ... We'll be monitoring the wiki’s effectiveness closely as we determine how best to take advantage of this technology in other areas. We’ll use wiki technology internally to make our processes more efficient for our teams and we will continue to expand our internal wikis in the coming year. We are also looking at better leveraging the community knowledge in the Dell Community Forums to allow our customers to more easily find the solutions they need. We are considering the idea of creating individual wikis with the knowledge distilled from threads in forum conversations. <br />
–From Dell.com  4/19/07) <a href="http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/62156">http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/62156</a></p>

<p>Clearly, the viability of customer communities is based on product characteristics as well as  corporate image. Complex products benefit from customer-centric communities. This is  especially so when a highly-knowledgeable base of customers already exists. Online games,  computers, puzzles and games, and photography are examples of complex product  environments that already have a mass community of expert-users who share information and  tips with their peers. They also help out “newbies” in troubleshooting. </p>

<p>A sample set of corporations using customer-centric wikis is mentioned in Table 4. These  are sites that the product or service firms own and operate. There are also a number of  collaboration sites that operate independently from the connected firms and yet are entirely  devoted to the product. For example, www.hardforum.com operates a number of forums for  computer components; www.howardforum.com operates a number of forums for cell phone  users. The users on these sites have developed their own set of norms on how to communicate.  A community norm on hardforum.com is for posters to list the products and components they  currently use in their signatures. Users can also be harsh on any posters who “pose” expertise.  Real expertise is highly valued – longtime posters often maintain their own blogs to keep a  current list of tips and tricks for specific components or gadgets. </p>

<p>One of the challenges to running a customer-centric wiki is the lack of control on content. If  a firm owns the site and begins to delete posts for a variety of reasons, it can backfire. At the  same time, it is counterproductive to retain information and posts that are inflammatory or  inaccurate. Managing this delicate balance can be time-consuming and expensive. This is one  of the reasons that independent product forums have been more successful. In fact, some firms  encourage their employees to participate in these forums to provide additional information. <br />
Firms also need to design mechanisms to align incentives. Some firms have experimented  with creation of micro-payment or credit systems to encourage users to post solutions or help  other customers. The credits accumulated over time can be used towards buying new  products. Lego  a maker of interlocking plastic blocks) has been experimenting with customerP generated ideas for quite sometime. Lego has created a software tool called Mindstorms for  users to create their own toy robots. Once a user builds a design for a robot, they can even post  their programs online for other customers to use. Lego has extended this concept further to  allow users to assemble custom kits of Lego blocks. In fact, other customers can also purchase  the custom kit once the customer shares the design voluntarily on the site. <br />
Mass collaboration is an exciting development. As with any new technology or platform,  there is considerable amount of enthusiasm among users to produce, share, and consume  content online. It is important to know that there is some amount of skepticism on the  sustainability and value of mass collaboration. First, quality of available content is an issue of  concern. Given the vast number of blogs that exist today on the WWW, it is natural that there  are many blogs that are of dubious quality. Second, validity and accuracy of the content cannot  always be verified or assumed. These two concerns should at least cause readers to critically  review the content before accepting its validity or accuracy. Yet, these concerns have always  been around even in print media. Additionally, the higher quality content is more likely to  receive higher visibility through the “small-worlds” phenomenon. The better content is more  likely to be cited and quoted often, and it is also likely to link to other content on the web –  and show up first on search engine results.  </p>

<h3 id="modulesummary">ModuleSummary</h3>

<p>As indicated early on in this course, business processes and strategies should be foremost  in our thoughts when we consider technology solutions. The course modules were designed to  emphasize the understanding of technology use in the context of business needs. </p>

<p>Despite the dot.com bust, technology innovation is still thriving. The developments in the  Web 2.0 space are a testament to the vibrant innovative community that is redefining business  models and social interactions. The unrelenting rise in computing, communication, and  storage power continues to create opportunities for new ways of analyzing information and  create opportunities to create new technology-enabled business models. <br />
Technology also has a disruptive influence on markets and industries. Collaborative  technologies are allowing firms to innovate on their sourcing models. These new sourcing  models are not only enabling firms to execute their processes globally; they are also creating entirely new markets for their products and services. Consequently, IT is too important a topic  to be ignored by managers. <br />
New technologies and terminologies can often be confusing and daunting for non-technical  managers who tend to delegate technology decisions to their IT departments. So the main  objective of this course was to provide a business context for prominent technologies in the  marketplace today. Once managers realize that they can approach technology solutions by first  identifying and exploring the business imperatives, they can better communicate to the  technical staff on the technology requirements. This way, both technology and business  executives can collaborate more closely to create value for the firm and its customers. </p>
