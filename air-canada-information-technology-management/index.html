            <blockquote>
  <p>By covering information technology (IT) management at Air Canada over two decades, this case illustrates the process of alignment between IT and business over time. During the 1990s, the focus was on efficiency and the IT department supported business through both the centralization of the IT function and the outsourcing of most of the IT activities, with the explicit objective of reducing costs. Twenty years later, at the time the case takes place, Air Canada had two key strategic objectives: operational excellence and customer proximity. In order to help meet these two objectives, IT now supported business through a hybrid structure and an innovation-based, "best-of-breed" sourcing strategy. Also, over the years, the IT department at Air Canada had developed processes aimed at ensuring efficient delivery of services by suppliers, as well as in-house processes to scan, identify and implement innovative IT solutions both for operational excellence and customer proximity.</p>

<p>Managing the information resource of a firm focused on both “engaging with customers” and competing “more effectively on multiple levels against the low-pricing structures offered by low-cost carriers” entailed many challenges, which Air Canada’s CIO and her team had been addressing in multiple ways. How was Air Canada addressing these challenges in 2011? </p>

<p>In 2010, Air Canada was already a thriving empire in the airline industry. They had gone through an extreme period of growth and partnered with many world renowned airlines and formed the Star Alliance. As 2011 approached,  Air Canada’s business strategy shifted from expansion to sustainment. In response to this strategy shift, two main business goals were developed: cost reduction and improved customer engagement. In order to reach their new business goals, they focused on three main areas that included “operational process improvements, supplier contract renegotiations and revenue productivity gains.”  </p>

<p>In 2011, efforts were focused on improving efficiency in these three areas;  therefore, they  implemented a “multi-vendor strategy in order to benefit from specialized, best-of-breed airline products available in the market more quickly and less expensively.”  A better sourcing strategy was needed which led to IBM being assigned to act as the “integrator” and  as the “keeper and guardian of Air Canada’s corporate standards.”  During this time, Air Canada also  moved to a relational approach “to manage its outsourcing contracts with multiple vendors.” To the CIO, “having a successful IT outsourcing contract meant being accountable for the problems that arise and taking a collaborative approach with vendors to problem solve.”</p>

<p>Aligned closely to a matrix organizational structure, the IT department had been reorganized to a new structure  and “an IT representative was assigned to each of the three main branches:  Customers, Commercials and Operation.” This new structure ensured that there was “one common goal: to link the business side and IT,” and that “new solutions had to add value to the business, be in line with corporate standards, and potentially contribute to the overall cost savings.”  Through this new reorganization and  implementation of IT, not only was cost reduction achieved, but customer engagement was also improved. By linking all IT within the organization, information was able to be shared throughout every department and improved the customer experience. Additionally, the Electronic Customer Relationship Management (e-CRM) team was developed, and through the sharing of  information this team was able to gather intimate knowledge on its’ customers and provide for their individual requirements.</p>

<p>In aligning its business and IT strategies, how did Air Canada cope with <a href="http://pompeiiconsulting.com/strategic-alignment" target="_blank">the five competitive forces</a>? In order to further improve its business-IT alignment, what areas should Air Canada target next and what actions should it take?</p>

<p>Air Canada recognized that in order to compete with low-cost carriers, it would require reducing costs.  Air Canada’s number one cost was fuel, which they had no control over; therefore, they instituted a Cost Transformation Program (CTP) focusing on “operational process improvements, supplier contract renegotiations, and revenue productivity gains.”  Air Canada’s strategy for coping with the five competitive forces included: <br>
Potential threat of new entrants -  Improved operational processes by entering major partnerships with Lufthansa and United/Continental.  These partnerships created barriers to entry for new airlines, who would struggle to compete with Air Canada’s global reach. Air Canada accomplished this through large investments in IT,  which allowed them to  maintain high quality and competitive  services with low cost carriers.   </p>

<p>Bargaining power of buyers - Allowed competition with the low-cost carriers as part of the CTP..  Lowered costs were achieved by using IT to optimize processes like the ones used by the pilots and crews for choosing flights.  The addition of customer facing systems, such as allowing customers to upgrade online or on mobile devices, increased buyer’s bargaining power in a mutually beneficial way. </p>

<p>Bargaining power of suppliers - In 2011, used multiple vendors to accomplish a bulk of its IT needs, thus lowering the leverage to each supplier.  Air Canada assigned IBM to be the integrator of each vendor’s product, ensuring a seamless fit with current and legacy systems. Additionally, contract negotiations were accomplished through the use of Requests for Proposals which breeds competition. </p>

<p>Threat of substitute products - Made the “cost” of switching airlines higher by being the first to introduce electronic boarding passes and then iPhone and BlackBerry applications.  The convenience Air Canada provided the customer likely factored into the decision-making process of the customers potentially considering switching airlines. </p>

<p>Industry competitors - Acquired their main rival (Canadian Airlines) and created partnerships with major airlines (Lufthansa/United Continental).  Using IT to drive costs down through innovation kept Air Canada a step ahead of its competitors.</p>

<p>Next areas for Air Canada to target should include the performance of research into the IT-business strategy of the major airlines with whom they partner.  Joint IT-business meetings between the partners could result in lessons learned for both sides, potentially lead to better integration of functionality between airlines and improve data sharing.  Investment in data analytics and analysis of customer, operational, and/or shared data for business intelligence should also be explored. .  </p>

<p>Future Air Canada actions should include having  the CIO and business teams from Air Canada, Lufthansa, and United/Continental meet on a regular basis.  The purpose of these meetings should include discussing and planning ways to integrate IT capability which ultimately will result in an increase in value to the customers and to the businesses.  </p>
