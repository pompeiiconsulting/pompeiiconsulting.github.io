				<p>During the ‘80s, when IT-based automations in organizations did not yield expected productivity improvements, managers began to question the business value of IT investments. Yet at the same time, reports began to emerge as to how some organizations were able to reap enormous benefits from their IT investments. A common theme in these organizations was that these IT investments were accompanied by changes in the design of their business processes. This realization created increased focus on cross-functional business process redesign, beginning in the mid-80s.</p>

<p>Since then, our ability to design and implement IT-enabled process oriented organizations has considerably evolved over the past three decades. More importantly, IT initiatives related to Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Business Process Management (BPM) systems are predicated on the existence of well-designed business processes. However, the task of designing processes has become harder due to the disappearance of boundaries both within and across enterprises.</p>

<p>Therefore, the main objective of this module is to impart sufficient understanding of the issues we encounter in evaluating, designing, and implementing IT-enabled business processes. It builds the foundation for process analysis by focusing on key aspects of business processes including collaboration, information flow, people, roles, and business rules. The module also provides an overview of techniques and tools of process analysis and workflow (i.e., a set of interconnected tasks) management including process mapping techniques and simulation <br />
￼</p>

<h2 id="informationsystemsandbusinessprocesses">Information Systems and Business Processes</h2>

<p><a href="http://pompeiiconsulting.com/strategic-alignment/" target="_blank">Porter’s value chain model</a> can be a useful framework for understanding the role of information systems and business processes in organizations. Porter’s value chain defines a set of interconnected activities that create and deliver products and services to customers. The value chain model identifies two classes of activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Primary activities – inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and after sales services.</li>
<li>Support activities – administrative infrastructure, human resources management, research &amp; product development, and procurement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these activities requires processing of information (collection and storage, analytics, and dissemination) and therefore information systems are ubiquitous in each of the activities. For example, ERP systems support a number of activities in both support and primary categories. However, it is rare to see ERP systems supporting R&amp;D or product development efforts. SCM systems primarily span inbound logistics, operations, and some outbound logistics activities, while CRM systems primarily support marketing, sales, and service activities.</p>

<p>An important takeaway from the value chain perspective is that business processes (i.e., value chain activities) drive organizational performance. Information systems support and optimize these processes. However, for information systems to create business value, it becomes imperative that the business process context is understood and appropriately utilized when designing, configuring or implementing information systems.</p>

<p>Information systems can create business value in a number of ways. Information systems can automate routine tasks in business processes so that employees are free to do more cognitively-complex tasks that create value. Using workflow management systems one can divide business process tasks into discrete steps and then electronically coordinate the various steps performed by different employees or organizations. Workflow management systems enable organizations to overcome time and location constraints in coordination. Information systems enable collaboration within groups and across firms. Web-based collaboration technologies such as Instant Messengers (IM), email, wikis, and blogs greatly enhance our ability to communicate and collaborate. </p>

<p>Information systems can allow for centralized control of business process execution. When processes can be monitored centrally, it is possible to achieve process standardization across geographic and functional boundaries. If judicially implemented, standardized processes create flexibility in workforce deployment. <br />
These different capabilities of information systems enable firms to strategically think of new business models and processes that add value to customer experiences with the firm.</p>

<h3 id="historicalbackground">Historical Background</h3>

<p>The business ideas marketplace is replete with buzzwords and cure-alls. Each new idea, however, has left an undeniable mark on how organizations are structured and work. In fact, many new ideas are a synthesis of well-known past ideas which needed a fresh perspective. Business Process orientation is one of those ideas that borrows from well-known disciplines and management ideas of the past. We can go all the way back to the 1890s to see the genesis of ideas related to process optimization. Frederick Taylor, known as the father of Scientific Management, was one of the first to propose systematic methods of work processes1. His methodology advocated a step-by-step observational and experimentation approach to evaluate the efficiency of work processes (in the labor-intensive manufacturing contexts of that era). Information gathered from the observations and experiments were then used to redesign and improve the process. Taylor also proposed the use of incentives and bonuses as a way to reward employees for efficient work.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma approaches gained popularity, especially in the auto industry. Both of these approaches stressed the need to systematically assess manufacturing and service processes to reduce errors and increase quality awareness to improve customer satisfaction. Six Sigma is a data driven methodology that continuously assesses process output and investigates ways to bring the process quality to a level where practically every output item would meet the specification. For example, a Six Sigma manufacturing process would produce less than 3.4 defects per million parts.</p>

<p>Hammer and Champy2 – the main proponents of “Business Process Reengineering” – defined process reengineering as a “Radical redesign of broad, cross-functional business processes with the objective of order-of-magnitude performance gains, often with the aid of information technology.” While TQM and Six Sigma approaches focus on improving quality and efficiencies of individual tasks, process reengineering takes a broader look at the organization structure and encourages managers to question whether a task adds business value. Hammer and Champy consider IT to be a central part of the reengineering strategy as it can fundamentally change the way we do our work. Many of the popular early reengineering success stories were successful IT projects that had been retro-fitted to the ideas and principles of process reengineering.</p>

<p>Yet a major difficulty in creating process-oriented enterprises is that it is difficult to identify business processes. This difficulty arises because many of today’s business processes have evolved over time – no one consciously “designed” them. Therefore, a big first step for many organizations is to determine what business processes already exist. But to discover them, we need to first define what they are. As you will see in the next section, there is quite a bit of variation in business processes that makes it hard to come up with a single, comprehensive definition of a business process.</p>

<h2 id="definitionofabusinessprocess">Definition of a Business Process</h2>

<p>A business process can be defined as a set of connected tasks initiated in response to an event, achieving a specific result for the customer and other stakeholders3. The focus on a trigger event is important. The work we do in organizations is mostly caused by an event: a customer has placed an order, a desktop computer has crashed, and a need to start a new advertising and promotion campaign has arisen. In response to the trigger event, a series of tasks are executed. The end result of the series of tasks is the process outcome.</p>

<p>While this definition seems simple enough, there are many ways managers stumble in defining the end-to-end series of tasks and events, even for simple processes. Difficulties become most obvious when we want to define process metrics to measure the outcomes. For example, how we define on-time airline performance depends on whose perspective is being considered. If it is an airline passenger’s point of view, it may be the time elapsed from entering the plane to claiming baggage and leaving the airport. From a pilot’s perspective, it may be the amount of time it takes for the aircraft to become airborne and land at its destination. From the airport’s standpoint, the time between the aircraft’s gate departure to becoming airborne could be the main focus. So, for the same process, each stakeholder has a different perspective of performance. However, the stakeholders collectively would be responsible for the end-to-end process performance from the customer’s perspective.</p>

<p>In general, consider that a process:</p>

<ul>
<li>is outcome oriented; you should be able to identify the output.
Examples: The product development process ideally results in a new product introduction while the order fulfillment process delivers a finished product or service to the customer.  </li>
<li>is for a customer and has stakeholders.
External stakeholders are the customers and investors. Processes can have internal stakeholders as well, such as employees; often, regulation processes include government agencies as stakeholders.  </li>
<li>has a trigger event.
A customer calling in with an order would trigger the order fulfillment process. A <br />
seller posting an item to auction triggers an instance of the auction process on E-bay.  </li>
<li>is a collection of interrelated tasks.
An auction process involves posting an item, a number of bid instances over the auction duration, followed by identification of the winner at the end of the auction duration. Shipping the item to the winner and receipt of the payment completes the auction process.  </li>
<li>is not a function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often managers confuse functional (i.e., departmental) boundaries as process boundaries. But this is a misconception; process boundaries frequently span functional areas. The accounting function is not a process; however, receiving amounts due, paying amounts due, and reimbursing travel expenses are processes within the accounting department.</p>

<p>Alternative Definitions <br />
The definition in the previous section encompasses many business processes that have a transactional- or workflow-oriented structure. But workflow orientation does not completely cover all the different types of business processes one encounters in today’s organizations. Business process outcomes that are heavily impacted by collaboration and communications do not nicely fit into this definition. So the following alternative definition of business process seeks to address this deficiency.</p>

<p>A process is any work that is recurrent; affects organizational capabilities; contributes to cost, value, service, or quality; and requires coordination.</p>

<p>More broadly, based on the nature of work, processes can be classified into three broad classes: Transactional, Collaborative, and Iterative. Table 1 provides a summary of features for these three types of business processes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Transactional processes have a clear, structured workflow orientation; are very operationally oriented through well-defined inputs and outcomes; and generally have a short time span (a few minutes to a few days). The main focus of the analysis in reengineering these types of processes is task structure.</li>
<li>Collaborative processes are team oriented; have limited structure in the way work is done (i.e., work may be assigned in an ad-hoc fashion); and have a longer time span (typically from a few days to a few months). The main focus of analysis in reengineering collaborative processes is communications and collaborations among team members.</li>
<li>Iterative processes are accomplished by large teams (they may be geographically dispersed). These processes may include a combination of transactional and collaborative processes. The main focus of analysis in reengineering iterative processes is the flow of information between teams and minimizing re-work.

<h2 id="designingabusinessprocess">Designing a Business Process</h2>

<p>Designing a business process requires a careful understanding of many aspects of the organization and process. Business processes often cut across multiple functional organizations (i.e., departments) and hierarchies within and outside the organization; therefore, the process must be well coordinated to achieve the business goals effectively. Coordination is simplest when the organization is divided into functional groups that do not share resources, products, or markets. Unfortunately, such a scenario is rarely seen in contemporary business organizations.</p>

<p>Given the complexity of a business process, achieving appropriate level of coordination requires a multi-pronged approach to understanding the operational core of the business process. Academic and practitioner research in this area has identified the workflow structure, information systems, business rules, and motivation structure as major components of the operational core (see Figure 2). These four aspects of a business process address different design features, but all four aspects need to be well-coordinated to achieve success.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Operational Core of a Business Process <br />
Workflow Execution <br />
Activities and precedence relationships among the activities together form the workflow structure of a business process. Workflow can be predominantly sequential at one extreme and predominantly parallel at the other.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequential interdependence occurs when one activity/process is directly dependent on another for its inputs or resources. An assembly line is a typical example of sequential interdependence.</li>
<li>Parallel workflow structure (or concurrent interdependence) on the other hand is characterized by execution of tasks simultaneously. Such interdependence can be seen in workflow structures of firefighting or race pit stops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Process designers typically focus on reducing handoffs, increasing concurrency, or increasing automated tasks within the process to enhance workflow efficiency. Workflow optimization efforts focus on achieving excellence in execution of routine tasks and thereby achieve efficiencies. Inherent in routine activities is the repeated interaction of employees over time with the business environment. Therefore, knowledge synthesis in a workflow context arises from systematic discovery of repeating patterns and creating a set of activities to optimally address those repeating patterns. Flexibility in workflow can be achieved through a cross-trained workforce. However, differing skill levels among employees can conflict with the goals of achieving efficiencies.</p>

<h3 id="informationsystems">Information Systems</h3>

<p>Information processing infrastructure in business processes is designed to minimize computation, acquisition, and communication costs (all three put together would be termed as the coordination costs of information processing). The design imperative is information coordination; that is, getting the right information to the right person at the right time to produce the right processed information. Information systems have the twin effect of increasing the role of middle managers in process management as well as enhancing the decision making process by helping people do higher quality work.</p>

<p>Information coordination is of utmost importance in processes that execute on a periodic basis such as project planning, budgeting, strategic planning, product design, and so forth. Such processes often lack the rich patterns of learning that could be obtained in a transactional business process. As such, information systems can enhance information coordination by focusing on storing documents, reports, and computational aids (e.g., spreadsheet models in project evaluation processes) to reduce the cognitive burden on knowledge workers.</p>

<h3 id="businessrules">Business Rules</h3>

<p>Business rules constitute the decision-making component of a process. In this context, the workflow execution steps are really a set of actions that interpret and implement business rules. Business rules are intended to guide and constrain the actions of the employees (or agents) in the day-to-day execution of the business process. Business rules can be both informal (i.e., unstated rules of business) and formal (e.g., policy manuals, or rules embedded in information systems). When a process is analyzed in-depth, informal rules can be discovered and embedded into the information systems. The extraction of business rules helps in training and cross-training of employees and builds flexibility into the process.</p>

<h3 id="motivationstructure">Motivation Structure</h3>

<p>More often than not, individual employees’ objectives and interests can be different from process objectives. Organizational culture, performance metrics, and incentive mechanisms are effective means to align process objectives with that of the individuals'. Incentive mechanism design in business processes cannot always assume that the process output is entirely under the control of the concerned employees. The managerial problem is to effectively motivate the employee’s effort through an incentive mechanism that recognizes the employee’s effort as well as environmental factors that have a bearing on the process output.</p>

<p>Employees respond to both explicit incentives and implicit relational contracts. Relational contracts are perceived obligations and expectations of the employees and the organization. To a large extent, organizational culture, trust, and relationships are part of the relational contract. The nature of the explicit incentives and relational contracts can lead to complex interactions among the other three aspects of the business process.</p>

<p>Most importantly, coordinating the interrelationships between the four aspects of the operational core of the business process is the challenge that organizations face in designing optimal business processes. A sample set of such challenges due to pair-wise interactions between the coordination aspects are provided in Table 2.</p>

<h2 id="whycreatingaprocessorientedorganizationisdifficult">Why Creating a Process Oriented Organization is Difficult</h2>

<p>Most of today’s organizations have grouped by product, geography, and functions that have evolved over time. Naturally, the process steps, business rules, information systems, and motivational structures have also evolved over time; they were not consciously designed based on a set of objectives. Given this, it is extremely challenging to infuse a process-oriented discipline into the organization, and as a result, a large percentage of business process change efforts do fail. Therefore, it is important for managers to understand the difficulties they may face in creating a process-oriented organization.</p>

<p>When large process-change efforts are initiated, the first challenge the organization faces are getting buy-in from the affected functional departments. The main reason behind this is that organizations are traditionally used to defining authority structures, goals, and objectives from a functional perspective. However, when we infuse process-oriented thinking into this type of organization, conflicts and confusion emerge. For example, functionally-oriented departments are often in conflict with the process structure because process goals may not necessarily be aligned with functional department goals (see Figure 3). It is therefore important to consider the alignment of process and functional goals before one considers the creation of a process- oriented organization.</p>

<p>Table 2 <br />
Pair-wise Interrelationships in the Coordination Mechanism Framework <br />
￼￼￼￼￼Coordination Aspects Considered
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Coordination Challenge in Designing the Business Process
￼￼￼￼￼Workflow / Motivation</p>

<ul>
<li>Design of incentives to prevent formation of bottlenecks in the workflow.</li>
<li>Compensating and motivating cross-trained employees.</li>
<li>Compensating employees when business processes are redesigned with an increase
in task complexity and workload. <br />
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Workflow / Business Rules
￼￼￼￼* Specifying authority relationships and assignment of roles and responsibilities in the workflow.</li>
<li>Business rules and procedures to handle exceptions that arise in the business process.</li>
<li>Workflow/overflow routing, resource allocation and scheduling decisions.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Workflow / Information
￼￼￼￼* Ensuring information access and resource access when workflow steps are executed in parallel.</li>
<li>Information systems to support accelerated task completions (for example, autofill of forms, creation of document and contract templates).</li>
<li>Streamlining information flow between locations and functional groups (wiki-based workflow environments, document management systems)
￼￼￼￼￼Business Rules / Information
￼￼￼￼￼￼* Implementation of decision support systems and expert systems to aid in decision- making.</li>
<li>Improving organizational memory to enhance decision-making capability through data warehouses and data mining.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Business Rules / Motivation
￼￼￼￼* Training employees to be adaptive to the business environment.</li>
<li>Analyzing incentives and organizational culture to improve relevance and
contextually of business rules.  </li>
<li>Analyzing business rules and incentives for possible control problems.
￼￼￼￼￼Information Systems / Motivation Structure
￼￼￼￼* Using real-time performance monitoring systems to improve incentive and performance measures.</li>
<li>Monitoring transaction information, information access to investigate possible violations of business rules and procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p>As shown in Figure 3, processes cut across traditional functional hierarchies. When we begin to think of process goals first and then evaluate how these process goals translate to functional department goals, the internal stakeholders begin to understand how important the process is to the success of the organization as a whole. Process goals, derived from customer and other stakeholder requirements, can then be decomposed into individual department level goals. For example, in Table 3, we define four different goals for a Loan Application Evaluation Process: (1) cycle time for application evaluation, (2) cost of processing a loan request, (3) level of bad debt due to the loans issued, and (4) errors in processing the request. If we assume that there are three different departments involved in the process, we establish the goals for each of the departments for the Loan Application Evaluation Process. If these departments also serve other processes in the organization, those process goals are defined separately and included when establishing the department level goals.</p>

<h2 id="howlackofmotivationderailsagoodprocessdesign">How Lack of Motivation Derails a Good Process Design</h2>

<p>One of the classic cases of failed process change highlights the importance of designing processes that consider multiple aspects of coordination. In this case, a computer company was in the business of selling custom-configured computing systems. At the time the order was placed, prices were quoted based on the customized configuration requested by the customer. </p>

<p>However, many of the configurations would result in incompatibilities between the parts. If hardware components had to be substituted to correct the configuration, the prices quoted to the customers could not be changed. Therefore, configuration errors eroded company profits and also caused delays in delivery, leading to customer dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>The engineers of the company attempted to reengineer the process by building an expert system that would guide the salespeople in configuring error-free systems at the time of order placement. The system was tested to ensure that it produced error-free orders.</p>

<p>However, several years after deployment, about only 10% of the salespeople continued to use the expert system. The development team addressed many usability issues related to the system, hoping that the improved user interfaces would increase usage. However, despite great improvements in the system, salespeople continued to ignore the system.</p>

<p>On examining the issues more closely, two root causes became evident:</p>

<ul>
<li>The salespeople believed the system inadequately supported the process they were engaged in – which was to sell a computer. In this context, they considered configuration as only a small part of the entire workflow. The salespeople had to assess how much a customer was willing to pay and then interactively create configurations to match it. However, the configuration system did not have any support for the pricing part of the process. It was time-consuming to repeatedly configure error-free systems and then price them separately to get customer approval.</li>
<li>The sales department’s incentives were not dependent on error-free configurations. All costs of configuration changes were charged to the manufacturing division. The sales people were only measured on sales revenues. This motivation structure created a disincentive for the salespeople to spend the extra time on the system to create error-free configurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hammer and Stanton (1999) proposed several measures that we can undertake to help create better alignment between process and functional goals. These measures are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish a process owner: A process owner is generally a high-level manager who collaborates with the functional unit managers to design and monitor the business process. A process owner is not a project manager. A process owner would train the individuals involved in the process and ensure that everyone is working towards achieving the process goals.</li>
<li>Establish a culture of collaboration: Process owners have to work with the functional department heads to ensure that process goals are met. Functional unit heads would be concerned with, among other things, resource allocations, reasonableness of goal, and employee hiring and training. In this type of environment, collaboration between process owners and functional unit heads is extremely important. One approach to enhancing collaboration is through clear articulation of the decision rights.</li>
<li>Align department budgets to process goals: Process goals should be used to establish the rational needs for resources, employees, and timelines. When process goals are translated to department level goals, the budgets for each department can also be rationalized through the different process-related budgets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="managingtheinevitablepitfallsinprocesschange">Managing the Inevitable Pitfalls in Process Change</h2>

<p>The operational core of business processes depicted in Figure 2 recognizes the salient role that Information Systems play in business process design. However, it is important to note that a large percentage of IT-enabled business process change efforts fail to meet the stated business goals. Using the knowledge gleaned from many case studies of IT-enabled business process change efforts, McAfee (2003) identified several factors that contribute to process change pitfalls. These pitfalls are “readily recognizable, consistent across implementations and unambiguously counter productive.”7 Five most commonly occurring pitfalls are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resistance – Disagreements over the process change decisions and/or process design that cause the process change effort to stall.</li>
<li>Inertia – Lack of progress on the process change effort despite (supposed) agreement on process design details.</li>
<li>Misspecification – Making incorrect process design decisions, creating a process or technology that “works” but is a misfit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a new process design is rolled out, there is a danger that we will encounter two additional pitfalls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Misuse – Improper employment of a new technology/process; in a sense, sabotaging the process design through creation of informal and undocumented processes and workarounds.</li>
<li>Nonuse – Lack of adoption of the process or technology; this behavior especially manifests when employees perceive the process or technology as discretionary.
Factors that contribute to these pitfalls can include:  </li>
<li>Process Factors: The number of processes impacted by the process change effort creates volume and scope related difficulties. The larger the number of processes being impacted, the more difficult it is to grapple with all the issues that can be encountered during process change. Additionally, process complexity arising from regulatory requirements, highly stringent requirements for the tasks such as in medicine, space instrumentation, and sophisticated supply chain practices cause pitfalls to emerge during process change. Process factors are the leading causes for the resistance and inertia pitfalls.</li>
<li>Organizational Factors: The number of organizational units (internal or external) affected by the process change impact potential success of the process change effort. While increasing the span of process change may enhance the potential business value, it also increases the risks of failure. When the process being changed is integral to the primary mission and objectives of the organizational units, resistance and inertia to the change is likely to manifest very early on during the effort. When resistance and inertia are effectively tackled, organizational factors can still cause misuse and nonuse pitfalls to emerge.</li>
<li>Technology Factors: Process change efforts may either choose to build customized technology solutions or buy off-the-shelf technologies to enable the process. However, both options have associated risks. Whether a technology is custom-built or bought off-the-shelf and configured, misspecification risks are inherent – especially when process complexity is high. Technology factors are often the predominant cause for the manifestation of misuse and nonuse pitfalls.
Several strategies can be pursued to effectively tackle the potential pitfalls. To mitigate resistance and inertia risks, the interface between the various organization units should be managed at the highest levels. The aim should be to build consensus among various stakeholders on the specific direction of the process change efforts and major decisions related to technology choices. If possible, phased implementation of the proposed process changes should be seriously considered. The incremental approach to implementation facilitates the collection of appropriate metrics to demonstrate the ongoing business value of the changes. Additionally, it enables a spirit of learning among the stakeholders as they get familiar with the impact of the changes on their daily work routines.</li>
</ul>

<p>To mitigate misuse and nonuse threats, training, educational materials, and workshops should be rolled out in a timely fashion. Pre-cutover training prepares stakeholders for the imminent change. Post-cutover training alleviates the inevitable changeover difficulties by tackling the operational issues as they emerge.</p>

<p>In essence, any technology-enabled process change is likely to encounter roadblocks. The process owner and the process change team can manage these pitfalls effectively if they correctly evaluate the organizational issues from the beginning of the process change initiative. The strategies employed by the team should be to mitigate the potentials pitfalls emerging from the process, technology, and organizational factors.</p>

<h2 id="greyhoundreengineersitselfoutofbusiness">Greyhound Reengineers Itself Out of Business</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, the reengineering buzzword had caught on and many companies took on reengineering projects that did not fit well with their business model. As a result, they managed the rollout of the IT-enabled process changes to the extent that the entire business was in jeopardy at the end. Greyhound Corporation was one such company that entered into bankruptcy due, in large part, to the misspecification of the technology and process designs.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the demand pattern for its bus lines, Greyhound began an overhaul of the reservations process. A big part of the reengineering plan was to create a new reservation system called “Trips.” Trips was a centralized reservation system that would allow travelers to make bus reservations over the phone (and Internet). The advance information would allow Greyhound to plan its resource allocations (drivers, buses, etc.) more efficiently. However, when the new process was rolled out, it was a complete disaster.</p>

<p>When rolled out to the entire nation, despite opposition from many managers, the Trips system could not handle the load. While airline reservation systems handled 1-3 stops, bus lines frequently had to contend with 5-10 stops for each reservation. With mainly part-time employees, the reservation system needed to be simple. However, it required more than 40 hours to train employees to use the system. Despite warnings from front-line and IT workers, the system was pushed into the market place, ostensibly to please financial analysts. Very soon the system had to be shelved. Within the next few months, Greyhound entered into bankruptcy proceedings. <br />
In the end, the process design attempted at Greyhound seemed to be unnecessary for a bus service. While it can be argued that a reservation system in markets connecting big metropolitan areas may have been a great value-add for some customer segments, it certainly was unwarranted for the entire Greyhound fleet. The customer base for Greyhound did not have sufficient computer access and probably didn’t plan its travels very much in advance to take advantage of the reservation system. This lack of focus on the needs of the business process seemed to have unnecessarily widened the scope of the system.</p>

<p>The top management seemed to have focused solely on one stakeholder group – the financial analysts. The cut-over plans were also ill-planned. Adequate training and preparation – the cornerstones of a good implementation plan – did not seem to have been considered or supported by the Greyhound senior management team. Additionally, cut-over to a new system during the busiest time of the year for travel compounded the problems.</p>

<p>A current version of Trips today allows ticket purchase online; however, no seat reservations can be made at the time of reservation.</p>

<h2 id="amethodologyforbusinessprocesschange">A Methodology for Business Process Change</h2>

<p>Given the complexities of process change, the entire process change initiative should be guided by a well-designed methodology. In this section, a suggested approach is outlined that can also be adapted to specific process change contexts. As such, the process change effort can be divided into five phases – Initiation, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Management. Each phase is intended to answer a number of basic questions that pertain to the process change effort.</p>

<p>The Initiation phase lays the groundwork for the process change effort. Many process change efforts begin opportunistically (e.g., a major client defects to a competitor, a competitor introduced a new product or service, a major equipment failure occurred at a factory, etc.). For instance, many airlines made massive changes to their business processes in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>It is also possible that the top management team calls for a major process change effort after a prolonged period of complaints from customers and stakeholders. For example, many customer relationship management-related process change efforts begin as a response to low customer retention rates and/or low customer satisfaction survey results. While it may be clear to the management team that a change is needed, it will not be certain as to where the changes should happen and which processes may be impacted. The initiation phase should answer the basic questions related to where changes may be necessary and what should be the goals for the reengineering effort. This is also the phase where core business processes and their metrics are identified. At the end of this phase, a preliminary set of candidate processes are identified for reengineering. The main checkpoints for the initiation phase and any documentation/work products resulting from the related activities are outlined in Table 4.</p>

<p>The Analysis phase documents the as-is or current process in greater detail. In this phase, all stakeholders are identified for the candidate processes; these include customers, managers, employees, and external entities. Additionally, for each process, the trigger events are gathered. These are the event(s) that trigger(s) the business process, milestones – the intermediate and significant events within the process – and endpoints, the event that signals the end of processing for the trigger event(s). <br />
The analysis phase helps to estimate the potential costs and benefits to customers and stakeholders in the as-is business process. When transforming a transactional process (refer to Table 1), the elicitation of trigger events and milestones helps to create high-level process flow diagrams. Main checkpoints for the analysis phase and any documentation/work products resulting from the related activities are outlined in Table 4.</p>

<p>The Design phase involves an analysis of the activities and steps in the process. Benchmarking the process against competing firms within the same industry and benchmarking against best performing firms even outside the industry can help identify possible redesign ideas. For example, Toyota’s production processes are known for efficiency and quality. Its processes have been adapted in both manufacturing and service environments; both corporate and government sectors have also attempted to mimic its approach. Brainstorming redesign ideas with the stakeholders is another useful method; in addition, conducting focus groups with customers can help bring in their perspectives to the design phase as well.</p>

<p>Any new Information System that enables the to-be process should be prototyped in this phase. The prototype system should be shown to the stakeholders to get feedback on usability and suitability to the redesigned work processes. The prototype also helps stakeholders visualize the process changes being considered. As feedback received in this phase is implemented in the Information System and process design, it should be communicated to the stakeholders.</p>

<p>In the redesign of transactional processes, creating as-is and to-be models and simulating the redesign ideas can help evaluate their impact. In the design of collaborative processes, changes to the organization culture and team behavior would be required; social network analysis techniques can be beneficial in this context (we discuss the social network approach in the next module). Iterative processes may require redesign and relocation of several different departments to facilitate better information flows.</p>

<p>The Implementation phase begins with pre-cutover preparations that test out the redesigned processes in selected locations/products/units. The pilot sites help refine the to-be process and facilitate the development of training and education materials for full roll-out. The pilot sites also help recruit early champions of the redesign ideas. These early champions can be great resources to market the process change ideas to the larger organization.</p>

<p>The Management phase continuously monitors the implemented process by tracking performance metrics. Recall the Capabilities Maturity Model (CMM) (see table below). A process at the highest maturity level is continuously monitored and improved to keep the process performance at an optimized level. In this context, the process owner’s role is pivotal. As described earlier in the module, the process owner takes on the training and mentoring role to keep the process performing at a high level.</p>

<h2 id="businessprocessmodeling">Business Process Modeling</h2>

<p>Most organizational processes are hidden; therefore, a systematic approach is required to discover and model these processes. In this module, the focus will be on discovering and modeling workflow-oriented processes. Documenting business processes is a great way to give managers and employees an end-to-end view of the business processes they are engaged in. When employees understand the process completely, they are better able to relate what they do to the overall objectives of the process they are engaged in. <br />
Process Documentation Approaches</p>

<p>One can document business processes by using text based narratives, drawing tools, or sophisticated modeling tools. While text-based narrative is the easiest way to capture process information, it has a few drawbacks. Complex business rules and flows can be hard to explain in words. While individual tasks may be easily explained in a document, the overall process map may be hard to visualize if everything is written in a text-based format. <br />
Drawing tools such as Microsoft Visio can also be used to document business processes. The process models in these documents would help stakeholders understand how the end-to- end process works. However, these drawings tend to be static – multiple views of the process (e.g., processes by role, resources, or departments) would require creation of new documents. It is also hard to check for consistency of the process flow. Advanced analysis of the process flow (for cycle time, resource usage, costs, etc.) is not possible in such drawings.</p>

<p>User-friendly and advanced-process modeling tools are becoming commonplace in the business process management marketplace. A recent Gartner report identified “pre-built frameworks, models, flows, rules and services” and “business process/policy modeling and simulation environment” as one of the key required functionalities in Business Process Management software tools8. Vendors with process modeling tools include IBM (<a href="http://www-">http://www-</a> 306.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimodeler/), CACI (<a href="http://www.simprocess.com">http://www.simprocess.com</a>), iGrafx (<a href="http://www.igrafx.com">http://www.igrafx.com</a>), and IDS Scheer (<a href="http://www.softwareag.com">http://www.softwareag.com</a>). These tools allow analysts to model business processes in a hierarchical fashion (such that different levels of details can be shown to different stakeholders). Additional process parameters such as resource requirements, time durations, locations, and departments can also be associated with the process model.</p>

<h3 id="processmodelsandservicesorientedarchitecturessoa">Process Models and Services Oriented Architectures (SOA)</h3>

<p>Until recently, modeling business processes used to be isolated attempts within the organization to understand and communicate process information. However, soon after the process models were built and communicated they would be forgotten. For example, it was rare to see software development teams use the process model; thus, the information system and process models seldom had anything in common. If eventually the process design was changed, it was unlikely that the documented process models would be changed. Therefore, the process models would quickly become outdated and unused.</p>

<p>However, recent technology advances have made process modeling an integral part of Information Systems and process management. In addition, emerging technology concepts emphasize re-use of information system components by taking advantage of Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). Therefore, building services based on defined business process models increases the ability to reuse components.</p>

<p>In most Business Process Management software tools, individual tasks can be first modeled as a workflow model. In turn, each step in the process can directly map to one or more of the services built using the SOA methodology. A business process can then be an assembly or composition of the set of services. This approach has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process models directly map to Information Systems components.</li>
<li>Changing a business process would mean a change in the way the different software services are assembled. Thus, process models and information systems can be kept in sync.</li>
<li>Real-time metrics (e.g., number of loan applications processed, cycle time, loan amounts disbursed, risk profiles of the loans, etc.) can be defined and monitored within the modeling environment.</li>
<li>To the extent that a process model is commonly used across various organizational units, the entire set of software services or a subset of the services can be reused in other processes.
The business value of modeling processes, especially in transactional processes, is increasing as the Enterprise systems are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. Process models no longer need to be “shelf-ware,” they are becoming central to the way we analyze, monitor, and manage business processes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modelingbusinessprocesses">Modeling Business Processes</h2>

<p>In this section we will discuss how transactional business processes can be modeled. First we will cover the fundamental patterns in creating the workflow. Then we will discuss how one can elicit the process flow details from the employees who participate in process execution.</p>

<p>From our definition of business processes at the beginning of the module, we know that business processes have events, interrelated tasks, and outcomes. Process models also have to show these events, how the tasks are interrelated, and how the end result is achieved from the sequence of activities. We know that events trigger process execution. However, the interrelationship between tasks occurs in one of several fundamental patterns, which we will now describe. If you have done flowcharting before, you will find that process models are very similar although a process model contains a lot more information. There are six fundamental flow patterns of interrelated tasks in a process model. A brief description of each pattern follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequence Pattern: This pattern models a series of tasks that are connected to another sequentially. A task begins only after the completion of the previous one.</li>
<li>Parallel Split or AND-Split: This pattern models two paths of tasks which can be performed in parallel (i.e., simultaneously). In the figure below, both Tasks B and C can begin execution simultaneously after Task A completes execution.</li>
<li>Exclusive Choice or OR-Split: This pattern models a decision task in the process. When the decision task is completed, only one of the alternate paths can be performed. In the figure below, either Task B or Task C can be executed after Task A is completed, but not both.</li>
<li>Synchronization or AND-Join: This pattern models the joining of two parallel paths. All the tasks within the two paths must be completed before the next step of tasks can be completed. This pattern is associated with the Parallel Split Pattern. In the figure below, Tasks B and C begin execution simultaneously (Parallel Split). For Task D to begin, both Tasks B and C must be completed.</li>
<li>Simple Merge or OR-Join: This pattern allows a set of alternate paths to flow through to a single path. This pattern is associated with the Exclusive Choice Pattern. Following completion of Task A, either Task B or Task C executes. Task D can begin execution once Task B or C is completed.</li>
<li>Iteration: This pattern models loop backs within the process. In general, decision points initiate loop backs in the process (e.g., when an error is detected).
￼</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elicitingprocessinformation">Eliciting Process Information</h3>

<p>Process modeling appears to be a deceptively simple task, but creating readable process models is really an art. Process modelers have to consider the context and various stakeholder interests in order to decide upon the right level of detail to convey the process-related information. Most process models are hierarchical – that is, they represent process information at different levels of detail.</p>

<p>One approach is to consider designing the process models as a storyboard. Storyboards were popularized by Walt Disney in the 1930s to visualize an animation movie before it was made. This technique has been adapted widely in the film industry to help producers, directors, and cinematographers visualize movie scenes and convey ideas to each other. Similarly, when modeling multiple processes, our top level model would show the overall interactions between processes. When expanding a single process, we would connect the major milestones in the process (akin to major scenes in a movie). Details between milestones are then shown in the next level and so on down to the lower levels that start showing the individual activities in the process.</p>

<p>To acquire the information necessary to create these types of process models, milestones are elicited from the process stakeholders through a series of workshops. The collected milestones are then sequenced by the process modelers and confirmed with the workshop participants. The individual activity level details are then gathered by meeting with smaller groups of participants who directly contribute to those processes. Existing information systems in addition to system and process documentations are also reviewed to ensure consistency of the process models.</p>

<p>When process models are expanded to the level where activities are defined, it becomes extremely useful for Information Systems Designers. The systems designers can expand on these diagrams to create “use cases.” A use case is a description of step-by-step interactions of users with the information system. The uses cases can also describe the business rules that govern the execution of the activity.</p>

<h3 id="swimlanemodels">Swimlane Models</h3>

<p>As-Is process models are needed to highlight the Who, What, and When of the process. The What and When are easily captured by the process boxes and connectors. However, the Who part is not explicit in a simple flowchart like process model. The trick to depict the Who part of the process is to use Swimlane models. Swimlane models assign a lane to each actor, resource, or department. Each level of the process model can show swimlanes describing different actors or departments of the process. Swimlanes can represent organizational roles (but are not typically used to represent names of individuals who perform the tasks). An Information System that is an integral part of the process can also be assigned a Swimlane to model workflow tasks performed by the system.</p>

<p>Swimlanes are also useful to show when hand-offs occur between actors, resources, or departments. These hand-offs are the points where coordination problems will likely emerge.</p>

<h2 id="processdesignprinciples">Process Design Principles</h2>

<p>In an earlier section we discussed strategies for managing the process change initiative to avoid the potential pitfalls. In this section we will briefly review some design principles that are intended to assist in applying known solution patterns to specific problem contexts. By their very nature, design principles tend to be generic and can many times be misinterpreted. However, when the design principles are adapted to the specific problem context, they can help generate valuable redesign ideas. We will begin by reviewing the design principles recommended by Hammer and Champy (1993)9. These principles are aimed at increasing the efficiency and quality of the products and services offered. Note that these principles are not necessarily independent of each other; we might need to apply all of the principles at once to achieve the desired process changes.</p>

<p>Combine several tasks into one: Traditionally tasks are broken into several steps and each step is performed by a different worker. This can introduce a high amount of variance in the process output and efficiency. If the tasks are combined into one, it provides a sense of responsibility and ownership for the worker performing the complete set of tasks. This would mean that the worker is cross-trained to do all of the steps which can – in and of itself – bring flexibility to the process. As a result, any time a customer wants to know the status of the application one single person will be able to report on its status. In essence, the worker becomes the case manager for that particular work entity.</p>

<p>Enable workers to make decisions: One of the ways we can combine tasks is by assigning decision-making authority to workers. For example, if we can clearly define the business rules for approving the loans based on credit worthiness, many workers can be trained to apply these decision rules and make the credit decisions. As they become more experienced in dealing with the complete loan application process, they can begin to introduce innovative ideas on how to improve the process as well. Despite this, there would still be a need to have specialists who can deal with the exceptions in the process. However, benefits have been gained when workers are allowed to handle the routine decisions; in this instance, the wait times in service lines were considerably reduced. This principle leads to a view of the organization in which lower levels of the organizational hierarchy make high-volume, routine decisions; the workers at the higher levels progressively make low-volume but more complex decisions.</p>

<p>Arrange the process steps in a natural order: This principle asks designers to question the flow of process steps and precedence relationships. Many constraints in process steps exist because of the lack of technology or because other process steps evolved around previous process steps. For example, paper-based processing imposes a sequential relationship between steps that do not necessarily depend on each other’s output. When an information system can make the forms or information available centrally, the sequential steps can begin simultaneously. <br />
Create multiple versions of processes: Today’s organizations can create a standard process and then create specializations of this process to accommodate the variability in the types of work it processes. For example, many credit card companies identify the type of cardholder (Gold, Platinum, etc.) before routing the call. The initial assessment of work type can be used to allocate a certain type of process worker or to determine the priority of handling. However, when the variability of the work type is very high, it is advisable to create distinct processes that do not overlap in resource usage. For example, in IT management processes, it might be useful to identify workers who primarily deal with network-related issues and workers who deal only with desktop computer-related issues.</p>

<p>Perform the work where it makes sense: One of the most attractive features of electronic commerce has been customer self-service. Most of us today perform the tasks that our travel agent used to do for us in booking airline tickets. Another example is the self-service checkouts that are becoming more commonplace in supermarkets. The same approach can work wonders in organizational processes as well. Many tasks were centralized in traditional organizations to ensure controls on spending. But information systems provide the visibility needed to centrally monitor or control many of the human tasks, therefore centralizing the tasks as well as the decision rights is unnecessary. For example, today most large organizations negotiate prices centrally with suppliers while it is the individual units within the organizations that make the actual purchases. Here, the price negotiation and purchasing tasks are separated and performed where it makes the most sense.</p>

<p>Checks and controls are reduced: Checks and controls in processes are meaningful if they are rare and significant. When checks and controls are routinely applied, they begin to impede on the natural flow of tasks within the process. Information systems, however, can provide the control ability without being intrusive. Constraints on decisions can be placed by incorporating appropriate business rules within the information system. Judicious analysis of the costs of errors should be examined to create appropriate control strategies. Another perspective is to use checks and controls as a means to create a learning environment. The Toyota Production System enables workers to stop the assembly line anytime they notice an error. The intent is to identify the root causes of the error at its source and fix it immediately. Each worker in the assembly line collaborates with the supervisor to analyze the error and institute corrective actions directly.</p>

<p>Reconciliation steps are minimized: When duplicate information is captured at multiple points, the potential for errors are magnified. Unfortunately, such situations are fairly common. Process workers often spend more time on reconciling information from different sources than on doing the actual work. Hammer and Champy use a scenario from Ford Motor Corporation to reinforce this observation. Ford’s accounts payable employees used to spend an inordinate amount of time reconciling the differences between purchase orders, invoices, and delivery notes. When the three pieces of information did not match, they had to follow-up with the supplier and the unit that ordered the parts. When Ford reengineered the accounts payable process, it required only the purchase order for the entire process. The supplier had to supply the exact quantity on the purchase order; if not, the delivery would not be accepted. Everyone in the process could view the purchase order in an online system. The number of reconciliations was reduced to a minimal amount after the process was reengineered.</p>

<p>In addition to these principles, the knowledge of how efficient production systems are configured naturally lead to additional principles of design. Highly-efficient production systems reduce batch sizes to a minimum that shrinks work-in-process inventory to near zero and allow upstream tasks to be “pulled” by downstream customers. This is also the basic principle behind “just-in-time” production; also meant to keep work-in-process inventory to the minimum. When the level of activity fluctuates in a process, capacity has to be increased to allow for peak time performance. To control process activities, managers should attempt to reduce the fluctuations in the workflow or create variable capacity levels to address the peak time performance levels. In addition, employees should be given simple visual cues to quickly identify deviations from performance standards.</p>

<p>The cases used as reading assignments in this module give you more opportunities to consider the usefulness of these redesign principles. In the next module, you will also begin to study how collaborative processes can be reengineered to accommodate mass participation from your suppliers and customers. Even in these collaborative processes, information systems play a crucial enabling role.</p>

<h3 id="varianceimpactonprocessperformance">Variance Impact on Process Performance</h3>

<p>The common theme throughout the above principles is an attempt to reduce the variability in process – whether it is in the inputs or tasks or outputs. See Figure 5 for a summary of the sources of variance and instruments for variance reduction in processes.</p>

<p>In the figure, the business environment includes competition and economy but would also encompass other things such as government policies, regulations, changes in consumer preferences, etc. Variance in input can occur due to changes in these business environment related factors. Many of these are mostly out of management’s control; managers can merely react to the changes (or try to predict some of the effects). Corrective actions to react to changes include pricing, promotions, creation of reward &amp; penalty structures, introduction of new products, and so on.</p>

<p>Organizations themselves also cause variance in inputs through their decisions. Advertising and promotions can cause a surge in demand for products or services; penalties imposed on customers in service environments may cause customer attrition or changes in the demand pattern. These input variances put a strain on the management of the tasks within the process. Managers must have adequate resources to handle demand surges; however, sudden drops in demand can also lead to increased costs due to excess capacity. As a result, both business environment and managerial actions impact input variability. The key difference is that managerial actions are intentional (i.e., under management control) whereas business environment impacts are less likely to be controlled by managerial actions.</p>

<p>Another cause of variances is the way a process itself is organized. As an example, unclear business rules or complex process designs can lead to an increased number of errors. These errors, in turn, can increase the variance in the output (through delayed deliveries or defective products or services). Variable traffic patterns to retail stores also cause difficulties in scheduling customer service representative times in the store. Managers can respond to these threats through several initiatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>To minimize variance in task processing times, they can increase the effectiveness of their training programs.</li>
<li>To deal with variable traffic patterns, they can use computerized scheduling systems to effectively plan employee work hours.</li>
<li>To accommodate peak traffic on their web stores, managers can outsource computing resource management to vendors who can provide scalable computing power on demand.</li>
<li>To improve worker productivity, managers can institute incentive and reward programs aimed at improving a culture of performance within the process.
￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it should be recognized that high input variance causes increased pressures on employees and managers in the process. As managers use computerized scheduling systems to address variations in traffic patterns, employees may see high amounts of variability in their schedules. This could cause hardships and/or conflicts for their families when planning around scheduled work hours on a week-to-week basis. <br />
Finally, performance metrics play an important feedback role for the organization. Performance metrics influence how employees respond to work; it can also influence the types of input traffic and demand. The feedback loop in Figure 5 from performance metrics to process and input is intended to show how measurement impacts process and its inputs. For example, if you use the “amount of time spent on a call” as a metric for a call center, it changes behavior of call center agents as they attempt to complete calls in as short a time as possible. Over time, this type of behavior can lead to dissatisfaction and cause customers to call back again and again to resolve problems – they might even stop doing business with the company (i.e., metrics had an undesired impact on process input as well).</p>

<h2 id="simulatingbusinessprocesses">Simulating Business Processes</h2>

<p>Static process models in the form of flowcharts are a good way to create abstract models of business processes. These static models help process stakeholders understand the end-to-end process visually. However, static models are not of much benefit in analyzing the impact of resource allocation decisions, bottlenecks, and random events. In such cases, simulation modeling tools can be used to analyze a number of different scenarios on both as-is and to-be process models. <br />
A number of common process-related dynamics are apparent from </p>

<p>Figure 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>The business environment may quickly change resulting in reduced customer order flow or materials supplies.</li>
<li>An advertising blitz promoting a new product may double or triple customer traffic to the e-commerce site, overwhelming servers and databases.</li>
<li>A new cross-training initiative may be considered as an alternative for an existing process that is dependent on specialized worker pools. The benefits of the cross- training initiative are being debated, but quantifying the benefits has been difficult.</li>
<li>The impact of worker absences on process performance has been hard to quantify.</li>
<li>The use of activity-based costing (ABC) is being promoted, but discovering the cost
drivers within the business process has been contentious. <br />
Simulation modeling tools can greatly help managers in assessing these dynamics. The benefit of simulating an as-is process with historical data is that it validates the accuracy of the process model to the stakeholders. The evaluation of various alternatives against the baseline (the as-is model) is then easier to justify.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to remember that models are abstractions of reality. We want to model only those attributes of the process that are important. Attempting to model every single step, information, resource, and cost would only serve to lengthen the process redesign effort without any corresponding increase in benefit.</p>

<h2 id="modulesummary">Module Summary</h2>

<p>Many business process design initiatives fall into the trap of either focusing entirely on technology to automate existing workflows or focusing on business rules and cultural issues without considering the enabling role of technology. Either approach fails to fully capture all the aspects of coordination mechanisms in a business process. In order to define new processes and even new businesses shaped by technology, one has to understand the workflow, information system, business rules, and motivation structures. That said business process change is a difficult proposition. It can simultaneously affect multiple organizational units; thereby, raising political flags of resistance and inertia across the organization. The synonymous link between process reengineering and layoffs does not help the situation either.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, reengineering concepts and methods have achieved a high level of maturity. The initial reckless approach of ignoring the detrimental impact on stakeholders (especially the employee) has been replaced by a more pragmatic approach to process reengineering. Reengineering does not always need to be a radical reorganization of the process to achieve the desired effect. As outlined in this module, a rational approach to process reengineering can yield pragmatic process redesign ideas that potentially accommodate a majority of stakeholder interests.</p>

<p>The design principles outlined in this module are applicable in most workflow design contexts. However, many business processes are not workflow driven. It is hard to identify task interrelationships in processes driven by information exchange and interpersonal communications. Many high impact business processes such as new product development, the budgeting process, designing advertising campaigns, and creating marketing strategies are highly collaborative in nature. Such processes require a very different approach to analysis and redesign. We will cover these types of processes in a subsequent course module.</p>
