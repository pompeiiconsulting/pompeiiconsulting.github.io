            <blockquote>
  <p>Focuses on a major transformation of Otis Elevator's infrastructure. Led by the CEO, this transformation represents a remarkable long-term reengineering of all the processes of the firm to drive its operating costs down and service image up. The transformation is the continuation of a process that has been going on for more than 20 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/product/otis-elevator-accelerating-business-transformation-with-it/305048-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a></p>

<p>The IT tools being used by Otis in 2004 were simple – database, workflow software, Intranets and Extranets, email – but the benefits appeared to be extraordinary. What are the things that really had changed in the company over the last few years leading up to 2005?</p>

<p>Otis Elevator’s earliest initiatives had been to build the business through massive acquisitions. Through these acquisitions, Otis was able to expand its customer base extensively and became the “largest manufacturer, installer, and servicer of elevators, escalators, and moving walkways in the world.”    While these acquisitions had been extremely profitable, Otis leadership knew that without consolidation and standardization of products and services within the company, that continued profitability would not be sustainable. </p>

<p>In the years leading up to 2005, Otis leadership recognized their business strategy needed to shift to compare to benchmark companies like UPS who had institutionalized customer service, and developed standardized  workflow processes and metrics to govern every customer interaction and internal activity. The vision moving forward was to become the recognized leader in service excellence among all companies – not just elevator companies – worldwide.</p>

<p>In order to align the  new vision with its business strategy, Otis needed to reduce the number of modules in use and lower project costs.  The SIMBA program was introduced to “fundamentally change the architecture and ultimately the design process; the goal was a standard-interface, modular-based architecture defining modules and subsystems from which all Otis elevator systems could be created.”  Also introduced with the SIMBA program was standard terminology. In the past, Otis verbiage varied so much throughout the organization that communications within the company could be misconstrued or misinterpreted. Through the implementation of a standardized terminology, important concepts such as “contracts, proposals, projects and field modules” would have the same meaning to any party requiring information as to the status of one of these steps in the development or implementation phase. </p>

<p>Tony Black of Otis Field Operations shared the “e-Logistics program which is based on the maturity of SIP.  If we hadn’t done SIP, and just did the e-Logistics program, it would have taken much longer.”   In sum,  Otis Elevator was no longer an “old-line can’t miss industrial firm, which only needed caretakers” as was the description provided by Tom Wolfe decades earlier. </p>

<p>With the e-Logistics program, best practice from SIP are baked into the company and institutionalized to achieve that continuous transformation. How do the systems that comprise the e-Logistics program bake in an institutionalized best practice?</p>

<p>Implementation of the  e-Logistics information transformation project provided Otis’ IT systems with the resources needed to “facilitate business process re-engineering that was taking place throughout.” This was  accomplished by taking the lessons learned from the initial Sales and Installation Process (SIP), and integrating them into a company-wide IT solution geared toward its evolving business model. The  e-Logistics program was built over a two year timeframe by gathering information from subject matter experts in the fields of “sales, field, and order management along with IT project managers.” By doing this, Otis was able to demonstrate the ideals of Pearlson and Saunders when they wrote, “In an organization that operates successfully, an overriding business strategy drives both organizational strategy and information strategy.”  </p>

<p>From an organizational perspective, the Project Proposal phase used a mandatory electronic pre-bid checklist which had to be approved by both the sales representative and the field-installation supervisor. Prior to e-Logistics, this was a manual process, and often times the field-installation supervisor did not even see the checklist or know the requirements until it was time for install.  Instituting this pre-bid checklist ensured the sales and field organizations worked together from the beginning of the process, increased process cohesion and allowed for minimal delays at install.  From an IS perspective, former manual systems, such as booking, validation and scheduling, became centrally automated.  This allowed for the e-Logistics software to automatically push data to appropriate supervisory and financial personnel.  Automated information sharing ensures each  party receives information  efficiently and decreases the need for middle  management. </p>

<p>The Order Fulfillment phase is another example of institutionalization, as field-installation supervisors were responsible for relaying when job sites were ready for deliveries.  The automated email service within e-Logistics prompts supervisors to check in on sites,  allows for status updates and face-to-face interactions with contractors.  This demonstrates how e-Logistics institutionalized site preparation, allowing for the implementation of the “pull” system.  Otis’ Tony Black said that the automated email and reminder process, “forces critical steps of SIP and makes good process part of the way you do business.”</p>

<p>By taking best practices from SIP and integrating them into the automated, e-Logistics program, it ensured both present and future Otis employees would execute these best practices.  This institutionalized, “baked in” program prevents best practices from being lost in two ways: 1) Mandatory use for nearly all employees, which helped Otis move away from many inefficient  manual processes and 2) best practices were now being held within the program, preventing an individual leaving the company and taking job-specific or institutional knowledge with them.  </p>
