  <p>This case explores the topic of offshoring high-tech jobs several perspectives. The issues presented include determining the stock price consequences of offshoring, examining the economic consequences of the offshore job to both the transferring and receiving countries, considering the competitive consequences of not offshoring, and thinking through the challenge of investing in a career that is vulnerable to future offshoring.</p>

<p>Use the sourcing decision cycle framework in Chapter 9 and analyze the situation where Global Information Systems, Inc. was in 2004. What kind of outsourcing decision did it try to make?</p>

<p>In 2004, GIS had reached a point in the sourcing decision cycle framework where they needed to decide to keep the status quo or change its sourcing model.  GIS had previously established their own in-house programming centers in India, China, and Brazil.  These are examples of captive centers.  Going forward, however, GIS was looking not just to grow into these captive centers, but rather to actively move existing U.S. jobs offshore. </p>

<p>In deciding whether to “make or buy,” GIS weighed whether it should shift some of its IT capability from make to buy, specifically 3,000 programming jobs. These jobs, formerly domestically insourced positions, would be outsourced to existing GIS locations in China, India and Brazil. The reason for supporting this approach was that huge capacity expansion plus large price reductions made it more efficient to establish customer service/call centers, software development centers, engineering design centers, and back office accounting centers in low-cost areas of the world that were developing politically and socially reliable infrastructures.</p>

<p>Due to the political landscape with respect to outsourcing, GIS faced a tough decision to outsource domestically or internationally.  The company eventually chose an international outsourcing model which projected to save them $261 million per year in human capital expenditure. For example, “a U.S. programmer with a total employment cost (salary and all benefits) of $112,000 per year would be replaced by an offshore programmer with a total employment cost of $25,000 per year.” Although roughly 35% of those savings would be consumed by telecommunication and management costs, after an initial loss of $19 million the first year and a savings of only $40 million the second year, GIS would net $168 million per year in savings by outsourcing these positions, from the third year onward. </p>

<p>The decision GIS was trying to make, which was eventually supporting by Harding, was a shift from insourcing to offshoring.  More specifically, GIS was considering selective farshoring, since they were moving specific IT capabilities (programming) but not all job functions to distant lands, with the goal of substantial cost savings. </p>

What are the key assumptions that could make offshoring a "win-win" situation for both developed and developing economies? How should Jane Harding advise her son Jason?</p>

<p>Key assumptions that could make offshoring a “win-win” situation for both developed and developing economies are that the offshoring countries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a cost savings through reduced labor costs </li>
<li>Provide highly educated and competent labor force</li>
<li>Provide continuing education to ensure support for technical upgrades</li>
<li>Ensure there are no language barriers</li>
<li>Ensure there is political stability</li>
<li>Have lower crime rates</li>
<li>Have friendly relations with the client company</li>
<li>Ensure security and/or trade restrictions</li>
<li>Keep company secrets and proprietary information private</li>
<li>Ensure availability of scalable technical infrastructure</li>
<li>Ensure cultural differences are known and negotiated prior to starting partnership</li>
<li>Account for time differences to ensure proper communication of deadlines</li>
</ul>

<p>Jane Harding’s son, Jason, requested advice on whether,  “he should pursue a degree in humanities or whether he should have a more ‘preprofessional’ focus to his studies such as on engineering, computer science or premed.”  When determining a career path, there are several areas to consider including career happiness (passion for the job), earning potential and stability of the chosen career path.</p>

<p>In considering the humanities,  there is no shortage of teachers in the workforce today and appears to be a sustainable long term career choice.  On the other hand, the mean annual salary is just under $80k, whereas premed for instance, has a mean salary in excess of $100k.</p>

<p>There are many factors that Jason must consider before making a decision, but it is also important that he becomes educated on the topic of outsourcing before deciding which area of study he will pursue. As technology evolves, locational dependencies become a much smaller factor when choosing a career path. Long-distance learning, and thus teaching, is becoming just as prevalent today as outsourced computer programming. The key for Jason’s success will be, not only the career path that he chooses, but the environment and and situation in which he does it. Although much of the traditional “Engineering” type work is being outsourced, there will always be parts of it that, for one reason or another, cannot be. For example, a network engineer that works for a public school may be replaceable through outsourcing, but the same job working for say a Department Of Defense school, for security reasons, may not be. When it comes down to the choice of which field of study is “safer,” there is not a definitive answer, because there are none. Jason must become educated in the field that he feels is right for him, and know that he will need to create a “niche” for himself in order to create his own job security. With technology breaking the restriction caused by location, this will likely be the case regardless of which field Jason decides to pursue.</p>
