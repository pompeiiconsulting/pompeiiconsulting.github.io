            <blockquote>
  <p>Many of the pioneers of Internet business, both dot-coms and established companies, have competed in ways that violate nearly every precept of good strategy. Rather than focus on profits, they have chased customers indiscriminately through discounting, channel incentives, and advertising. Rather than concentrate on delivering value that earns an attractive price from customers, they have pursued indirect revenues such as advertising and click-through fees. Rather than make trade-offs, they have rushed to offer every conceivable product or service. It did not have to be this way--and it does not have to be in the future. When it comes to reinforcing a distinctive strategy, Michael Porter argues, the Internet provides a better technological platform than previous generations of IT. Gaining competitive advantage does not require a radically new approach to business; it requires building on the proven principles of effective strategy. Porter argues that, contrary to recent thought, the Internet is not disruptive to most existing industries and established companies. It rarely nullifies important sources of competitive advantage in an industry; it often makes them even more valuable. And as all companies embrace Internet technology, the Internet itself will be neutralized as a source of advantage. Robust competitive advantages will arise instead from traditional strengths such as unique products, proprietary content, and distinctive physical activities. Internet technology may be able to fortify those advantages, but it is unlikely to supplant them.</p>

<p>Why isn’t a business strategy sufficient for a company to determine how it can leverage IT for competitive advantage? Based on the descriptions of "Strategy and the Internet", how would you characterize Walgreens’ business strategy and IS strategy in using the Internet for its business?</p>

<p>Business strategy alone is not sufficient for a company to determine how it can leverage IT for competitive advantage. As stated in the IS Strategy Triangle slide, “companies are said to be in alignment when their business strategy is supported/enabled/driven by their information strategy.” The business strategy must be adhered to first and foremost with the organizational and information strategy supporting and aligning with it. In order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, the business needs “to be more profitable than the average performer,” according to the Strategy and the Internet article. The article further indicates that operational effectiveness, and strategic positioning are key drivers for competitive advantage. Business strategy and IT both come with their own strengths.  In Managing and Using Information Systems, the author states that “IS and business maturity must be aligned to provide the right level of information resources to the business.” It is imperative that IT be leveraged as a participant in the overall business strategy, but sustainability and profitability need to be the key drivers. <br>
Walgreens’ business and IS strategy can be characterized as a two-pronged model for success. By integrating the internet (i.e. online ordering services), rather than cannibalizing or forfeiting their established core business strategy (brick and mortar stores), the company was able to increase the success of its existing business model through the use of a complementary arrangement between the two channels. Walgreens embraced the ideals from the article that stated, “Established companies will be most successful when they deploy Internet technology to reconfigure traditional activities or when they find new combinations of Internet and traditional approaches.” This ideal allowed them to reach a larger, more diverse customer base, while continuing to satisfy its existing one. <br>

Use the Porter’s 5 competitive forces model, perform an analysis similar to the one by Porter on pages 5-7 in “Strategy and the Internet,” and predict how the phenomena of Web 2.0 like social networking would influence industry structure and profitability for an average firm?</p>

<h3 id="threatofnewentrants">Threat of New Entrants</h3>

<p>(-) “Sharing economy” has drastically reduced the barriers to entry for service work, both on-site and remote. (-) Lower barrier to entry for products, ideas can be shared and go viral over social media. (-) Crowdfunding, such as Kickstarter reduce capital requirements for entrants into a product category. (+) Synergy between established physical locations and mobile, such as grubhub and postmates, adds value to existing infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="bargainingpowerofbuyers">Bargaining Power of Buyers</h3>

<p>(-) Bargaining power of end user increases due to ease and availability of information about new, alternative, and rival products. (-) Buyers can insinuate a bidding war, by having firms compete on price (-) Buyers have drastically increased power and voice due to social media, with a tweet can become a national headline. (+) Happy and vocal customers with clout on social media can advocate for a firm, for free or through sponsorship.</p>

<h3 id="bargainingpowerofsuppliers">Bargaining Power of Suppliers</h3>

<p>(+) Sites and platforms such as Alibaba and SalesForce allow for more choice and alternatives when a firm is selecting a supplier for a product or service that can increase fit and thus efficiency. (+) “Sharing Economy” has allowed for an alternative to some services, à la carte and in a reliable fashion; less overhead, more flexibility. (-) Suppliers, of both goods and services, can more easily go direct to market, bypassing the firm.</p>

<h3 id="threatofsubstitutes">Threat of Substitutes</h3>

<p>(-) Social/viral advertising allows for alternative products to gain consumer mind share more easily than before. (-) Mobile allows for substitute products to be found not just at home but from nearly anywhere, even in a firm’s retail location. (-) “Sharing economy” has allowed easy competition on the services side, creating alternatives that never existed before. (+) Social engagement and brand recognition can help buffer against new entrants, by forming a relationship with customers.</p>

<h3 id="industrycompetitors">Industry Competitors</h3>

<p>(-) Social engagement with customers is mandatory order to stay relevant and competitive to others in the industry. (-) Reduced competitive advantages in organizational systems as SaaS’s such as SalesForce continue to dominate the market. (+) Increased similarities in organizational systems can increase the ease of acquisitions.</p>
