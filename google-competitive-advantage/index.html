  <p>The case 'Google Inc.' describes Google's history, business model, governance structure, corporate culture, and processes for managing innovation. It reviews Google's recent strategic initiatives and the threats they pose to Yahoo!, Microsoft, and others. It also asks what Google should do next. One option is to stay focused on the company's core competence, i.e., developing superior search solutions and monetizing them through targeted advertising. Another option is to branch into new arenas; for example, build Google into a portal like Yahoo! or MSN; extend Google's role in e-commerce beyond search, to encompass a more active role as an intermediary (like eBay) facilitating transactions; or challenge Microsoft's position on the PC desktop by developing software to compete with Office and Windows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/product/google-inc/910036-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a></p>

<p>What were the key factors behind Google's early success? Google currently enjoys approximately 70% market share of US searches, and well above 90% in many other countries. Do you expect the search business to become more concentrated (i.e., dominated by fewer firms)? Is search a winner-take-all business?</p>

<p>The key factors of Google’s early success were its superior search engine, synergistic revenue generation, and its innovative corporate culture. The foremost factor is Google’s search engine. Early internet search engines were typically curated by hand, but as the number of webpages grew and existing pages were continually updated, this became impractical. Later, search results were automated using keywords, but this led to a lot of spam and useless results. Google’s innovative PageRank algorithm favored pages that were referenced/linked to by other pages; this method produced better search results and user experience than competitors could offer. </p>

<p>Google continued to improve on their competitive advantage of superior search technology through “sponsored links.”  At the time, the competition used the highest bid to determine ad placement, but Google took relevance and click through rate into consideration. By integrating this with Overture’s practice of bidding for pay per click with their own strategy of pay per view, they created an incentive for advertisers to provide more useful results for users. This worked synergistically to increase customer experience while also increasing Google’s profitability.</p>

<p>Google used its thriving revenue generation to hire some of the best talent in the industry.  Further, employees were permitted to work on projects outside the core business for 20% of the workday, which eventually led to products like Gmail and Google News. By not being evil, they engender trust amongst their users. This trust allowed them access to more user data, which in turn allowed them to create better products and services leading to superior customer loyalty.</p>

<p>Over time, the search business has become more concentrated and will continue to do so. It is currently either a monopolistic or duopolistic system. In the latter case, there’s usually only Google and a local market player. It’s unlikely that these local players will completely disappear, and Google is unlikely to acquire these competitors for fear of antitrust litigation.  Over time, these minority players will become more marginalized, leading to a winner-take-nearly-all system. Bing is the second-largest search provider, at 19% market share.  This is likely because Microsoft browsers use Bing as their default search tool. Even still, there is only one player in the market whose name has become synonymous with the function it provides.  “Google” is the only verb in the search industry and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Should Google pursue portal, software, and/or e-commerce opportunities? In other words, in addition to enhancing its core search businesses, should Google also branch out into new arenas of (a) building a full-fledged portal like Yahoo!'s, (b) targeting Microsoft's desktop software hegemony, and/or (c) becoming an e-commerce intermediary like eBay?</p>

<p>Should Google build a portal like Yahoo!? <br />
No.  Google’s top executives have indicated they believe this is a “tired model.” After emphasizing a business strategy based upon “playing their strengths,” the idea of watering down the service they provide with additional content seems to be counterintuitive.  Also, if Google were to shift focus from being a “search function” to being more of a “search suite” they would likely also require a restructure of their “work priorities” to support a new, more developmental business strategy.  Google previously pursued a portal service called iGoogle, but discontinued support in 2013.  According to Google’s support site, the service was discontinued because Google believed portal services were less useful given the advent of applications and widgets available on smartphones.</p>

<p>Should Google develop desktop software? <br />
Yes.  Entry into desktop software would be a worthwhile venture for Google, especially given their current presence in the operating system market with ChromeOS.  All software could be aligned with existing Google products such as ChromeOS, the Chrome browser, and Gmail, creating a seamless user experience on computers and mobile devices alike. The software suite could be supported on the cloud and loaded on mobile phones and tablets through the already existent Google Drive.  The main advantage to having a software suite in addition to the Google Drive offerings is allowing users to have a fully functional offline capability that augments and integrates with Google’s existing products. </p>

<p>Should Google become an e-commerce intermediary like eBay? <br />
No. In order to enter the arena with competition such as Amazon and eBay, an enormous amount of capital would be required, and success would not be guaranteed.  With the modularity that Google has developed, and the ability to “add-on” to other applications, such as utilizing Google Drive for storage, or Google Wallet for payments, they should stick to doing what they are good at.  This strategy falls in line with Google’s emphasis on playing to their strengths.  Rather than starting an e-commerce intermediary from scratch, a more logical move would be to hone their Google Wallet application and bond it to an already existing e-commerce solution, just as PayPal did with eBay. This would require much less capital and likely fit well into Google’s already existing prioritization structure. Further evidence against an e-commerce solution is Google’s dominance in the search engine market.  There is a potential conflict of interest that arises in the instance of an online shopper searching Google for a product to purchase, only to find the Google e-commerce solution is the first result.This could dissuade online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay from future dealings with Google’s suite of products, such as accepting Google Wallet for payment or paying for prime advertising on sites like YouTube.</p>
