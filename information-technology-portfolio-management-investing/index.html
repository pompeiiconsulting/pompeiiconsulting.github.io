<h2 id="buildingabusinesscaseforit">Building a Business Case for IT</h2>

<p>IT organization is charged with providing solutions</p>

<p>An IT business case</p>

<ul>
<li>created to gain support and go ahead decision on an IT proposal</li>
<li>is similar to a legal case</li>
<li>is a structured document that lays out all of the relevant information needed to make a go no-go decision</li>
<li>helps establish priorities for investing in different projects</li>
<li>identifies how IT and the business can deliver new benefits</li>
<li>gains commitment from business managers</li>
<li>creates a basis for monitoring the investment</li>
</ul>

<p>A framework for identifying and describing both financial and non-financial benefits for a cost-risk-benefit analysis for a business case </p>

<h2 id="itportfoliomanagement">IT Portfolio Management</h2>

<ul>
<li>IT portfolio management refers to the process of evaluating and approving IT investments as they relate to other current and potential IT investments</li>
<li>IT investments should be managed as any other investments would be managed by an organization</li>
<li>involves picking the right mix of investments to enjoy synergy, in lower risks and greater returns</li>
<li>don’t put all of your eggs in one basket</li>
<li>goal is to invest in most valuable IT initiatives that generate maximum benefits</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assetclassesofitportfolio">Asset Classes of IT Portfolio</h2>

<p>Four assets classes of IT investments</p>

<h3 id="infrastructuresystems">Infrastructure Systems</h3>

<ul>
<li>the base foundation of shared information technology services used for multiple applications</li>
<li>46% of IT expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transactionalsystems">Transactional Systems</h3>

<ul>
<li>systems that streamline or cut costs on business operations</li>
<li>25% of IT expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="informationsystems">Information Systems</h3>

<ul>
<li>systems that provide information to control, manage, communicate, analyze, or collaborate</li>
<li>18% of IT expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategicsystem">Strategic System</h3>

<ul>
<li>system used to gain competitive advantage in the market place</li>
<li>11% of IT expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="valuingitinvestments">Valuing IT Investments</h2>

<p>IT investments are difficult to assess value for because:</p>

<ul>
<li>IT can be a significant part of the annual budget, thus under close scrutiny</li>
<li>the systems themselves are complex and calculating the costs is an art not a science</li>
<li>many IT investments are for infrastructure; the payback period is much longer than other capital investments</li>
<li>oftentimes the payback cannot be calculated because the investment is a necessity rather than a choice</li>
<li>there is no tangible payback</li>
</ul>

<p>IT investment valuation is necessary</p>

<h3 id="approachestoitvaluation">Approaches to IT Valuation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Return on Investment (ROI)
<ul><li>ROI= (Estimated lifetime benefits - Estimated lifetime costs) / (Estimated lifetime costs)</li></ul></li>
<li>Net Present Value (NPV)
<ul><li>Calculated by discounting the costs and benefits for each year of system’s lifetime using present value (PV)</li>
<li>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</li></ul></li>
<li>Economic Value Added (EVA)
<ul><li>EVA = (net operating profit after taxes) – (capital) x (weighted average cost of capital)</li></ul></li>
<li>Payback Analysis
<ul><li>Time that will lapse before accrued benefits overtake accrued and continuing costs</li></ul></li>
<li>Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
<ul><li>Return that the IT investment is compared to the corporate policy on rate of return</li></ul></li>
<li>Weighted Scoring Methods
<ul><li>Costs and revenues/savings are weighted based on their strategic importance, etc.</li></ul></li>
<li>Prototyping
<ul><li>A scaled-down version of a system is tested for its costs and benefits</li></ul></li>
<li>Game Theory or Role-playing
<ul><li>These approaches may surface behavioral changes or new tasks attributable to a new system</li></ul></li>
<li>Simulation
<ul><li>A model is used to test the impact of a new system or series of tasks; low-cost method</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optionspricing">Options Pricing</h2>

<ul>
<li>NPV involves only tow choices
<ul><li>we do</li>
<li>we don't</li></ul></li>
<li>options pricing allows one to take future action in response to uncertainty about changes in the business environment</li>
<li>offers a risk hedge strategy to minimize negative impact of risk by waiting to see what happens</li>
<li>applicable when
<ul><li>an investment can be deferred</li>
<li>a balance between waiting for information and forgoing revenues</li>
<li>emerging investments</li>
<li>prototyping investment</li>
<li>technology as product investments</li></ul></li>
<li>Used along with DCF when the decision to pursue an investment can be deferred for some period of time</li>
<li>many investments particularly strategic ones like IT bear a strong resemblance to a financial call option</li>
<li>a call option is an option but not an obligation to buy an asset with value (S) by paying a pre-set price (X) on or before a certain point in time
<ul><li>European Option: on a specific date</li>
<li>American Option: on or before a specific date</li></ul></li>
<li>NPV only allows managers to make a decision now on an asset and then see what happens</li>
<li>managers can get to wait and see what happens, until some uncertainty is resolved and then make decision to invest or not</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="realoptions">Real Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>real options allow managers to defer investment decisions and enjoy:
<ul><li>reduced uncertainty</li>
<li>interest income earned on deferred expenditure</li></ul></li>
<li>Requires
<ul><li>set up a mapping between a project and a call option</li>
<li>related the option to a DCF valuation and perform an option valuation</li>
<li>extract managerial insights from the option pricing framework</li>
<li>call option valuation model is the Black-Scholes Model</li>
<li>option analysis complements but does not replace DCF NPV</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mappingitprojecttorealoption">Mapping IT Project to Real Option</h3>

<ul>
<li>S Stock price
<ul><li>PV of IT project's assets to be acquired</li>
<li>PV (assets to be acquired)</li></ul></li>
<li>X Exercise price
<ul><li>IT expenditure needed to acquire the assets</li>
<li>PV (expenditure)</li></ul></li>
<li>Time to expiration
<ul><li>decision deferral period</li>
<li>t</li></ul></li>
<li>Risk free interest rate
<ul><li>time value of money</li>
<li>r</li></ul></li>
<li>Variance of return or stock
<ul><li>risk of IT project's assets</li>
<li>σ2</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relatingdcftooptionvaluation">Relating DCF to Option Valuation</h3>

<ul>
<li>NPV = PV(asset) - PV(expenditure now) = S - X</li>
<li>Invest now if NPV &gt; 0 </li>
<li>NPVq = PV(asset) / PV(expenditure later)</li>
<li>Project is in the money if NPVq &gt;1</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="optionvaluation">Option Valuation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Project risk is the variability of return on the project per unit of time measured by the variance of return σ2</li>
<li>multiplying the variance per unit of time by the time periods remaining gives cumulative variance σ2t</li>
<li>cumulative volatility = σ√t</li>
<li>knowing NPVq and σ√t we can lookup the Black-Scholes determinant, a percentage %, from a table</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>natural tug: options tend to move up in the real option as time passes</li>
<li>only tow forces can push a real option up before time runs out: good luck and active management</li>
<li>managers can increase value and reduce cost to move the option to the real option up</li>
<li>be careful of spillover effects in an option portfolio and nested options in an IT strategy (an option that influences other options in a series of decisions)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="potentialissuesofitrealoptions">Potential Issues of IT Real Options</h3>

<ul>
<li>uncertainties and risks in real options add a new element to the capital budgeting problem</li>
<li>σ is usually between 20% and 40%</li>
<li>many investment decisions are complex with interdependencies and synergies among projects and options</li>
<li>IT investments often do not result in easily measured cash flows</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="itinvestmentmonitoring">IT Investment Monitoring</h2>
