  <p>Due to deep changes in technology, demographics, business, the economy, and the world, we are entering a new age where people participate in the economy like never before. The new participation has reached a tipping point where new forms of mass collaboration are changing how goods and services are invented, produced, marketed and distributed on a global basis. The change presents far-reaching opportunities for every company and for every person who gets connected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most business professionals have heard of the new buzz words Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0.  Initial definitions of these buzz words referred to new web technologies  such as RSS feeds,  wikis, blogs, social bookmarking, etc.) that became popular after the dot.com bust. These buzz  words also indicate an increased intensity of collaboration and co-creation among peers that is  revolutionizing the way companies and people interact. <br>
We are all used to collaborating with others within our work environments  think  meetings, shared network drives, emails back and forth). We also collaborate outside of the  workplace with people of similar interests  home owners associations, church groups,  volunteer organizations, parent-teacher associations). More recently, some of you may also  have collaborated with people whom you have never met  supply chain partners, various  forums, Yahoo! or google groups, Facebook). These different spheres of collaborations  Figure  1) basically happen inside organizations  team collaborations), between organizations  interG organizational collaborations), and within communities  mass collaborations).  </p>

<p>Team, Inter-organizational and mass collaborations are inherently different in purpose,  context, and behavior. Traditionally, the boundaries between these three types of  collaborations were clearly defined as well. However, new Web 2.0 technologies are blurring  the boundaries between these different types of collaborations. Consider, for example,  Research &amp; Development – most companies would look to the internal R&amp;D organization for  ideas on new product developments and improvements to existing products. Today, many <br>
firms  examples include Procter &amp; Gamble, 3M, NetFlix and GoldCorp) depend on open  collaborative communities  see for example, <a href="http://innocentive.com">http://innocentive.com</a> ) as well as internal R&amp;D  organizations to solve several vexing product development problems. <br>
In this module, we will explore technology enabled collaboration models in each of the  spheres of collaboration. We will discuss technologies, managerial issues and analysis  techniques that help us better understand how effective collaborative models can be created  and sustained. </p>

<h2 id="teamcollaborations">Team Collaborations</h2>

<h3 id="considerthefollowingscenarios">Consider the following scenarios:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Imagine you have just won a project from a prestigious client. The client is a big  pharmaceutical company with manufacturing facilities all around the globe. Your  project is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the client’s supply chain  management practices in the Latin American manufacturing facilities. Although you  have worked for over 10 years on various projects in the pharmaceutical industry,  you have never headed a project in the Latin American countries before. You believe  you need some members with previous Latin American project leadership  experience on your team. You think Charles Turner, whom you had worked with  two years ago on a project in Mexico, can help.   You call Charles and explain your needs to him. While Charles would have liked to  work with you, he is already committed for the next six months on other projects.  However, Charles connects you with Mike Crain, who is a perfect match for your  project. Charles sends an introductory email to Mike, and recommends that the  three of you get together to negotiate an arrangement that meets your and Mike’s  interests. At a subsequent meeting, not only does Mike agree to work on the project,  he also brings with him three other experts who bring valuable pharmaceutical  industry supply chain expertise to the project.  </p></li>
<li><p>Your CEO calls you up late in the evening on Tuesday, informs you of a business  opportunity, and asks you to prepare a proposal by Friday. Many of your trusted  colleagues are spread around the world at this time. You know you can count on  them to help, but you need some way to collaborate over email, IM, phone, or other  means to prepare the proposal. Many of the members on your team, who will be  needed to prepare the proposal, have not worked together before. You are worried  that different versions of the proposal will be flying around over the emails that will  make it hard for the team to collaborate. You also wonder whether they will have  the right chemistry to handle such a high pressure deadline in a matter of four days.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Situations like these are quite common in today’s global corporations. GeographicallyG dispersed teams are often formed in a matter of days; then the teams have to quickly learn  how to collaborate and contribute effectively towards the success of the project. While  traditionally members from a single organization would collaborate, today it is quite common  to see teams from different companies come together to design, develop, or market a product  or service. A more recent trend is also to have an “open source” approach, where any member  of the public can potentially contribute to the development of a product or idea.  </p>

<p>In these types of processes, collaboration, information exchange, and work culture play a  crucial role. The effectiveness of the process is dependent upon how well the team members  connect with each other and how the culture of collaboration is intrinsically absorbed by all  those who participate.  </p>

<p>The modeling approach outlined in the previous module has only a limited role to play in  these types of contexts. Therefore, we will explore emerging issues with respect to how  organizations are approaching the design of collaborative business processes and discuss how  existing business models are being radically changed as a result of the advances in  collaboration technologies. </p>

<h2 id="classifyingcollaborativework">Classifying Collaborative Work</h2>

<p>Researchers have attempted to classify collaborative tasks along many dimensions. The  main intent behind these classifications is to better understand how collaborative work can be  supported with technology. <br>
One way to classify collaborative tasks is based on time and space dimensions1. On the time  dimension, collaborations in teams may happen synchronously  e.g., a face-to-face  conversation) or collaboration may happen asynchronously  e.g., by email). On the space  dimension, all collaborators may be in the same location  e.g., in a meeting room) or at  different locations  e.g., via a conference call or webinar). </p>

<p>It is also important to consider what types of tasks are accomplished in teams. McGrath   1984)2 classified group tasks into four types in a framework called task!circumplex: Generative,  Choice, Negotiation, and Execution  see Figure 3). </p>

<ul>
<li>Generative tasks are creative tasks, including those that generate new ideas or new  plans.  </li>
<li>Choice tasks include problem solving tasks where there is a correct answer; and  decision-making tasks where a preferred answer is chosen. </li>
<li>Negotiation tasks are characterized by resolution of conflicts – for example, policy  formulations. 
￼2 McGrath, J. E.  1984). Groups: Interaction and performance. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.￼</li>
<li>Execution tasks that may be primarily physical  for example, construction jobs) and  those that are measured against some objective standards  most multi-step  workflow processes). </li>
</ul>

<p>Using this framework, it is also possible to see how interdependence between team  members manifests. For instance, Generation tasks benefit from close cooperation between  team members. Choice and Execute tasks benefit from increased levels of coordination  between team members. Negotiation  to an extent, Execution and Choice) tasks require  considerations for resolving conflicts. <br>
You will readily notice that we can place collaboration tools and technologies in the Time Space dimension as in Figure 4. Notice that some of the technologies under different  time/different place can also be used in the other quadrants. However, as we begin to focus  more on the types of tasks performed by groups, the question of task-technology fit becomes  more salient. For example, what types of collaboration technologies are good for coordination  intensive tasks? Are there collaboration technologies that help in generation or negotiation  tasks? These are harder questions to answer. <br>
In many cases, the organizational context and culture further complicate the use of  collaboration technologies. Verbal and non-verbal cues in collaborative activities are extremely  important for the team members as they convey valuable information and feedback in group activities. Collaboration technologies are inherently imperfect in conveying these visual cues.  Additionally, collaboration technologies can change the way group members interact. For  example, multiple members can simultaneously type their views in a chat room session;  however, in a face-to-face meeting, it is difficult for team members to simultaneously speak.  However, the multiple messages appearing in the chat room session can make it difficult for  users to follow the discussions. <br>
We will explore the task-technology fit in a bit more detail in the following section. </p>

<h2 id="fitbetweencollaborationtechnologiesandcollaborationtasks">Fit between Collaboration Technologies and Collaboration Tasks</h2>

<p>While the time-space dimension is a useful way to understand different types of  collaboration needs, the most common basis on which collaboration technologies are classified  is based on the type of task support they provide. Collaboration technologies and systems  provide three basic types of task support:</p>

<h3 id="communicationsupport">Communication Support</h3>

<p>Communication aspects of collaboration systems support, define,  and enhance the ability of group members to exchange information. Communication  capabilities may include group displays, simultaneous input, and anonymous  communications. </p>

<h3 id="processstructuring">Process Structuring</h3>

<p>Collaboration system-specific processes define the way groups interact  in group tasks. These capabilities include creation and enforcement of team agendas. </p>

<h3 id="informationprocessing">Information Processing</h3>

<p>Collaboration systems can structure, aggregate, and analyze the  information exchanged between team members. </p>

<p>Collaboration system features may cover some or all of these features – although, typically  they focus more deeply on one of the three aspects. For example, workflow systems provide  process structuring support; blogs provide communication support; and, group voting  systems provide information processing support. <br>
Bafoutsu and Mentzas  2002) review over 47 different commercial collaboration systems  and identify a number of different collaboration system capabilities4. In Table 1, the  collaboration system capabilities are organized by the task support they provide. <br>
￼￼

To define the appropriateness of a collaborative system, we consider the resulting impact  on group performance. However, group performance can be defined over several performance  dimensions – effectiveness, efficiency, perceived satisfaction with outcome and/or process, etc.  Still some preliminary prescriptions on how well collaboration systems fit a given task type  can be made.  </p>

<p>Idea generation tasks  refer to Figure 3) that are simple in nature  such as brainstorming  sessions) would benefit from better communication support as it facilitates rapid generation of  ideas from members dispersed over time and space dimensions. However, adding information  processing or process structuring features for these type of tasks can be counterproductive as  the focus is mainly on creating as many ideas as possible.  </p>

<p>Choice tasks that require team members to evaluate multiple available alternatives  e.g.,  investment decisions) against a single objective  such as ROI, profit, etc.) would benefit from  better information processing capabilities. Aggregation and summarization of information can  help reduce the information burden on the team members. Minimal communication support  would be needed in such contexts. </p>

<p>Execution and more complex choice tasks  with multiple competing objectives and  requiring the creation of unique solutions) would benefit from both information processing  and process structuring support. Software development and web page development teams  frequently use version and access control mechanisms to ensure that the created solutions are  well-coordinated. In these types of tasks, project management capabilities can enhance  coordination levels and overcome time and space constraints. <br>
Negotiation tasks that deal with conflicts in value and motivation can benefit from  information processing and communication support features of the collaboration system.  Voting, polling, and online surveys can help surface and resolve contentious issues during  team processes. Communication support would be essential to reduce the level of uncertainty  and mistrust among team members. However, any process-structuring support such as  agenda setting can be counterproductive as it might limit the free flow of communication  between team members. <br>
It should be remembered that the organizational and team culture influences how a  collaboration system is used. Therefore, it is important to consider both task-technology fit and  the social structures and culture within teams when implementing collaboration technologies. </p>

<h2 id="collaborationsystemsusageinorganizations">Collaboration Systems Usage in Organizations</h2>

<p>IBM, with over 300,000 employees worldwide, was one of the pioneers of collaboration  systems usage. IBM used several different tools to enhance knowledge and information  sharing, and collaborations across time and geographic boundaries. A tool called, TeamRooms   a Lotus Notes-based collaboration tool), was to enable employees to setup shared  collaborative spaces. Eventually, over 27,000 TeamRooms were active within IBM5. IBM also  operated periodic focused collaborative sessions on various topics. A recent collaboration  forum called Global InnovationJam was run over multiple days that had over 50,000  participants from around the world. These participants included IBM employees and their  family members in addition to IBM’s customers and business partners.  </p>

<p>Today, organizations can choose collaboration tools and technologies from multiple  vendors. Capabilities range from generic Enterprise level collaboration tools to process-specific  implementation of collaboration capabilities within industries and organizations. The wide  variety of tools does not actually reduce the risks of choosing the wrong strategy for  collaborative processes. In my opinion, it may distract managers from the real issues at hand  for designing effective collaborative structures within teams. </p>

<p>The years of experience with collaboration technologies within IBM has highlighted issues  related to adoption and effectiveness of these technologies6. Most importantly, collaboration  success depends on how well the team members adapt to a new way of working and not on  technology itself. Dorsett  2001) indicated three key contributors to success in IBM’s  collaboration systems usage as follows: <br>
5 Powers, V., “IBM’s KM Strategy,” KMWorld, 2006. <a href="http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/PrintArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16907">http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/PrintArticle.aspx?ArticleID=16907</a> 6 Dorsett, L., “A  Fast) Week in a Digital Collaboration Space,” Training &amp; Development, Vol. 55 Issue 1, p51-53, 2001. <br>
￼￼￼
• The Team Leader understood the leadership role in the new environment and the  importance of appropriate process for engagement in the TeamRoom. 
• The team members were trained in a face-to-face setting over a two-day workshop  to help them understand the team’s mission, the norms for information exchange,  and the process for making decisions inside the TeamRoom. 
• Before using the collaboration environment, the team members agreed on the  specifics of the new collaboration process. If agreement was not reached, the  collaboration environment was not used. 
Managers who work with geographically dispersed teams also agree on the importance of  face-to-face contact in the early phases of the group development process; additional face-to-face interaction can only foster social bonding amongst the team members. Additionally, the  incentives for using the collaborative environment should be set up-front. From a behavioral  standpoint, increased levels of transparency in collaboration systems can make some members  uncomfortable. This is because collaboration systems can readily track participation and  commitment levels of team members over time. The increased visibility and accountability of  team members need to be made explicit to the team at the beginning of the engagement with  the collaboration system. <br>
Team#Work#in#Organizations# <br>
Since our discussions so far have stressed the need to understand the context of  collaboration, it is instructive to review the types of teams we encounter in organizations.  Team leaders who understand the team context are better equipped to deal with them.  Sundstrom et al  1990) provide a typology of work teams which helps illustrate four major  types of teams7. </p>

<h3 id="adviceteams">Advice teams</h3>

<p>like committees, review panels, and advisory councils, are created to  broaden the information base for managerial decision-making. Advice teams require a low  degree of technical specialization and coordination and, depending on their purpose, can have  short or long life spans. Some of their typical outputs are decisions, suggestions, and  recommendations. These types of teams rarely need specialized collaboration systems, unless  the committee draws its membership from across different geographical or organizational  boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="productionteams">Production teams</h3>

<p>like assembly teams, data processing groups, and maintenance crews,  are responsible for performing day-to-day operations. While the minimal training required for  routine tasks calls for a low level of technical specialization, these teams do require a high  degree of coordination. Some typical outputs for these teams include components, assemblies,  and customer service. These types of teams benefit the most from coordination support  through workflow management and other similar applications. <br>
￼￼</p>

<h3 id="projectteams">Project teams</h3>

<p>like research groups, planning teams, engineering teams, and task forces,  require creative problem solving involving high degrees of specialized knowledge.  Coordination for these teams can range from low  traditional units) to high  crossGfunction  units). Examples of outputs are plans, designs, prototypes, and reports of findings. These types  of teams benefit from communication and coordination capabilities in the collaborative  system.  </p>

<h3 id="actionteams">Action teams</h3>

<p>like sports teams, negotiating teams, military squads, and entertainment  groups, involve high degrees of both technical specialization and coordination. In other words,  these are examples of brief performance events often repeated under new conditions. Typical  examples include combat missions, expeditions, and competitive events. These types of teams  benefit from collaboration systems that emphasize coordination and information processing  capabilities.  </p>

<p>It is also possible that teams can evolve from one type to another or can have components  of all four types. For example, project team composition and responsibilities can change  throughout the lifecycle of the project. </p>

<h2 id="modelingtechniquesforcollaborativeprocesses">Modeling Techniques for Collaborative Processes</h2>

<p>Several useful modeling approaches can be beneficial in collaborative process contexts. In the  following, two important modeling approaches are described. The first, Design Structure  Matrix, helps in appropriately designing a collaborative process based on the information  dependencies between the various sub-processes. The second, Social Network Analysis, helps  in addressing the deficiencies and strengths of a team’s social structure. </p>

<h2 id="designstructurematrixdsm">Design Structure Matrix (DSM)</h2>

<p>In iterative business processes, it is important to consider the sequencing of processes since the  processes can be highly interdependent. Note that the dependency here need not be from a  workflow perspective. For example, when one is designing a new product, the different  components in the product can be independently developed as long as the groups share the  design information with each other. However, if one group has to change the design  specifications, it can have cascading effects on rest of the product teams. Therefore, sequencing  the development of the different components based on dependencies can create efficiencies in  product development process. Similarly, in software development projects it is important to  sequence the development of software components such that the dependencies are optimally  accounted for and there is minimization of rework when software specifications are altered  during the development process. </p>

<p>Design Structure Matrix is a modeling approach that assists in optimally designing an iterative  process using dependency relationships between various sub-processes or components. The  dependencies are depicted in the matrix in different ways. One approach is to simply  represent whether any two components have dependencies in binary format  e.g., ‘1’  indicating dependency, and ‘0’ indicating no dependency; alternatively, ‘x’ indicating  dependency, and a blank indicating no dependency). It is also possible to show strength of dependency between components by using scaled entries  e.g., dependency strengths could be  shown on a scale of 1 to 10 with higher numbers indicating stronger dependency).  </p>

<p>DSM is a square matrix  i.e., same number of rows and columns) and the columns and rows  represent the components or sub-processes. Forward dependency is represented in entries  below!the!diagonal, and iteration  or feedback loop) is represented in entries above!the!diagonal.  We will use an example  see Table 2) related to Kodak’s design process adapted from Ulrich  and Eppinger  1999) to illustrate the modeling concept8. The different sub-processes here are  typical of a product design process. When reading a row, a ‘1’ in a cell  Row: I, Col: J),  indicates that the sub-process represented in row I receives input from the sub-process in  Column J. For example, activity, 3:Design Beta Widgets, is dependent on  or receives input  from) activities 1, 2 and 6. Reading Column 3 for the same activity indicates that it provides  input to Activities 4, 5, 6 and 7. <br>
￼￼ 
The entries above the diagonal in the matrix  marked in red) indicate feedback loops or  iterations. Iterations in iterative processes create rework and can delay the process cycle time.  For example, any rework due to feedback from “Test beta Widgets” to “Design Beta Widgets”  can cascade into additional work for sub-processes that are dependent on “Design Beta  Widgets.” Thus, it is important to  a) minimize feedback loops, and  b) minimize the  consequences of feedback loops on the process. When the above-diagonal entries are close to  the diagonal, the impact of feedback loops are minimized. It is also possible to combine subG processes  i.e., reorganize the teams for better collaboration) and reduce the impact of rework. <br>
￼￼
￼DSM allows you to recognize some basic patterns in the process. For example, sub-processes 4  and 5 are independent. These two sub-processes therefore can begin in parallel. The same applies  to sub-processes 10 and 11, and 12 and 13. Sub-processes 1 and 2; 2 and 3; 5 and 6 are examples  of sequential configuration. The implication is that sub-process 2 can begin after sub-process 1  is completed; similarly, sub-process 3 begins after sub-process 2 is completed. Finally, some  sub-processes are coupled. For example, sub-processes 7 and 8; 8 and 9 are coupled subG processes. The coupled pattern is an indication that the two sub-processes need considerable  exchange of information. 
The benefit of modeling the process in DSM is that there are tools available to generate  alternative configurations to optimize the process. For example, using a DSM add-on in  Microsoft Excel, we can re-organize the above DSM  see Table 3). The reconfiguration is  termed “Partitioning the DSM.” The algorithm suggests that “Design Beta Widgets” and “Test  Beta Widgets” be closer to each other  perhaps through co-location or integrated team). The  colored boxes along the diagonal are also suggestions for sub-process integration. For  example, if sub-processes 7, 8 and 9 are integrated they would reduce the impact of the  dependencies between them. <br>
DSM tools can also suggest groups of tasks or processes that can execute in parallel through a  technique called “Banding.” Fewer bands in the process indicate that more tasks or subG processes can start in parallel. Note that feedback loops are generally not considered when  banding a DSM. <br>
For more examples of DSM usage and its variants please visit: <a href="http://dsmweb.org/">http://dsmweb.org/</a>.  </p>

<p>Organizations today have greatly reduced the layers of management in their organization  structure. One consequence of the flattened organization structure is that significant work is  accomplished in ad-hoc teams such as the ones mentioned above. Over time, interactions  through ad-hoc teams create informal networks among individuals who find it useful to  maintain professional and personal relationship with team members they have worked with  before. The scenarios described at the beginning of the module highlight the usefulness of such  informal networks. Increasingly, organizations are beginning to realize the potential of such  informal social!networks. These networks exist outside of the formal organization structure.  When informal social networks are utilized effectively, they can greatly increase  organizational flexibility and innovativeness. <br>
In this context, many organizations are realizing the importance of informal social  networks within and outside the firm. More importantly, when firms assess the structure of  the informal network, they can actually influence its growth and structure in specific ways to  reap greater benefits from the networks. However, analyzing informal social networks  requires the use of a technique called </p>

<h2 id="socialnetworkanalysis">Social Network Analysis</h2>

<p>We will briefly review the  concepts related to social network analysis next. </p>

<h3 id="socialnetworkanalysissna">Social Network Analysis (SNA)</h3>

<p>A social network is a representation of relationships between people or organizations.  Social networks can be shown either in the form of a network diagram or in a matrix form.  While the SNA method has been used in academic disciplines for many years, improved  computing power has enabled the modeling of large scale networks in recent years. SNA is a  popular analytic technique in public health, management, anthropology, biology and other  fields.</p>

<p>Social networks are built in a group context where information on relationships is obtained  by surveying the group members or by observing the communications patterns of the group  members  emails, meetings, previous engagements, etc.).  </p>

<p>To illustrate, let’s consider a group consisting of five members: Adam, Bryan, Cindy,  David, and Erin. The relationship between these members is shown in the form of a network  and a matrix in Figure 5 and Table 2. <br>
In the matrix  Table 4) we represent the existence of a relationship between two individuals  by placing a 1 in the corresponding row and column. If no relationship exists, a 0 is entered. It  is straightforward to move from the matrix form of the social network to the network form.  We represent each individual as a node in the network. A link is drawn between two nodes if a  1 exists in the cell corresponding to the two nodes in the matrix.  </p>

<p>￼￼￼￼The network shown in Figure 5 is bi-directional, i.e., there is symmetry in the relationship  between any two nodes. Social relationships need not always be symmetrical. For example,  when communication patterns are used to construct relationships, it might be possible that the  communication always happens in one direction  say, Adam writes to Bryan, but Bryan never  writes to Adam). Similarly, if we are capturing information through a survey and ask the  respondents to indicate who they would approach for advice, the resulting network is also not  likely to have symmetry. </p>

<p>To get acquainted with social networks you can visit one of the many web resources that  show examples of interesting social networks. One such site is <a href="http://www.theyrule.net/">http://www.theyrule.net/</a>. You  can build interactive social networks showing the connections between members of board of  directors of prominent US firms. These networks show how different US firms are linked to  each other through their board members. A sample network connecting some of the large U.S.  corporations is shown in Figure 6. </p>

<h3 id="socialnetworkmetrics">Social Network Metrics</h3>

<p>When large numbers of individuals are included in the network, the visualization of the  network structure may provide valuable insights. However, for a more thorough analysis,  different types of metrics may need to be computed. The following is a sample list of such  social network metrics. <br>
Degree'Centrality: Degree centrality simply measures the number of connections an  individual has with others in the network. Nodes with more connections have more options  for their communications needs. Degree centrality is often a measure of power and prestige  within the network. <br>
In Figure 5, Adam has a degree centrality of 2; Bryan has a degree centrality of 3. </p>

<p>Another approach to defining centrality in a network is to use the closeness!centrality  measure. One way to define closeness centrality is to find the number of connections that an  individual must go through to reach everyone else in the network. <br>
For each member represented Figure 5, the network requires at most two connections to  reach everyone else in the network.  </p>

<p>When you order the nodes in the network by the centrality measure, you will be able to  identify individuals or entities that are central to the relationships and communications within  the group.  </p>

<h3 id="networkdensity">Network Density</h3>

<p>Network density is the proportion of connections in a network relative  to the total number of connections possible  i.e., if every node is connected to every other  node). Density is a measure of how closely knit the group is. If the group has a high number of  connections, the group is likely to be more closely knit and collaborative. </p>

<h3 id="groupcohesion">Group Cohesion</h3>

<p>Cohesion in a group implies that there are multiple connections and paths  between actors. In a sense, network density is one measure of cohesion. When multiple paths  exists between nodes, the group is more resilient to loss of a node  for example, a team  member quits the firm) and communication between nodes is faster. Cohesion is also tied to  higher levels of trust and collaboration. <br>
Group cohesion  apart from network density) is measured using the average of the number  of connections for one node to reach another node in the network. The average over the entire  network gives a measure of the level of cohesion in the network. Group cohesion can be  applied to subsets of nodes within the network as well  to analyze the cohesiveness of cliques  within the teams).  </p>

<h3 id="coreperipheryandcliquestructures">Core periphery and Clique Structures</h3>

<p>Visualizing the network structures provides  valuable insights on the nature of cohesion and subgroups in teams. Two popular ways of  characterizing overall network structures are the corePperiphery and clique structures. </p>

<p>In a core-periphery structure, there is a set of nodes that are central to the network  i.e., a  larger number of connections) and a number of other nodes exist at the periphery of the network  i.e., fewer connections). The central nodes are the information brokers  i.e.,  communicate information to others). <br>
In a clique structure, a single core does not exist. Instead, a number of closely knit subP groups connect to each other and the sub-groups connect to other sub-groups through a  smaller number of connections. <br>
Figure 7 illustrates social networks with core-periphery and clique structures.  </p>

<p>￼Core-periphery structures have been noticed in some firms where the nodes in the  periphery were more likely to be top managers and the nodes in the core tended to be middle  level managers. This is not necessarily a good scenario as the senior managers may be out of  sync with their own organization. In such situations, interventions may be necessary to  introduce the top managers back into the core of the network.</p>

<p>Clique structures are more common in firms that have recently acquired new firms. The  informal networks of the old firms have been known to persist even in the new organization  despite changes to the formal organization structure. Again, specific interventions may be  necessary to break the cliques. </p>

<h3 id="collectingnetworkdata">Collecting Network Data</h3>

<p>Interestingly, basic information required to build social networks already exist in firms. To  build networks for SNA one can use the following sources of information: </p>

<ul>
<li>Email archives</li>
<li>Conference call records and meeting minutes </li>
<li>Documents produced in recent history by different teams in the firm</li>
<li>Expertise profile and previous assignments </li>
</ul>

<p>Analysts can use these sources of information to get initial insights on the type of networks  that exist within the firm. However, relationships are contextual in nature – we approach  different people for different needs. Therefore, employee surveys may be necessary to gain  insights on specific types of informal networks. Past research on SNA, especially in corporate  contexts, indicates that different types of informal networks may provide valuable information  to analysts and managers9,10: </p>

<h2 id="informationnetworks">Information Networks</h2>

<p>Individuals seek out and approach their colleagues for advice and  information. Survey questions can be designed to specifically seek out these types of  information-based relationships. Information networks reveal how well employees know each  other’s knowledge, skills, and abilities. <br>
Access'Networks:'Even when we know someone has the necessary skills or knowledge to  address the problems we face, they may not be readily accessible. Accessibility may be  hampered by geographic distance, organizational structure, or interpersonal relationships.  Access-related survey questions could probe accessibility of individuals within the  information network from the perspectives of timely availability, quality of interaction, and  engagement.  </p>

<h3 id="trustnetworks">Trust Networks</h3>

<p>When faced with really complex and sensitive issues, employees tend to  approach only those they fully trust for advice and problem-solving help. In essence, this  would be a network that the employee engages with in crisis situations. Naturally, Trust  networks tend to be smaller than Access networks.  </p>

<p>Clique structures are also more likely to show up in Trust and Access networks.  Information networks may be more likely to exhibit core-periphery structure.  </p>

<p>You may have already noticed that the type of information gathered in building social  networks is quite sensitive. It is usually advisable to engage an outside consulting firm to  explore the social networks with the assurance that collected data will not be shared with  others  including senior management) in detailed format. The discussions and deliberations should be based on the overall network structure  with identifying information removed) and  not on individual relationships.  </p>

<h2 id="technologyandorganizationalinterventions">Technology and Organizational Interventions</h2>

<p>Specific interventions to improve social relationships can be undertaken based on SNA  results. Technology and organizational interventions can be designed to improve the network  structure. </p>

<h3 id="cliquestructure">Clique Structure</h3>

<p>In cross-functional organizations, such as consulting firms,  employees bring different skill types and orientations. Social relations in these firms  can be fragmented leading to sub-groups within each functional area  technology  experts, strategy experts, marketing experts, etc.). Organizational measures that  bring together these disparate groups could include formation of cross-functional  teams and mixed incentive structures to promote collaboration. Increasing face-to- face interactions among the group members would have more impact before any  collaboration technology solution is considered. </p>

<h3 id="bottlenecks">Bottlenecks</h3>

<p>While core-periphery structure in a social network is desirable in  organizational contexts, it can lead to a few individuals becoming bottlenecks.  Information flow in the network can become too dependent on one or two  individuals. These individuals can become bogged down through their involvement  in multiple teams and meetings thus becoming a bottleneck for all collaborative  work. When such situations are encountered, specific managerial interventions will  be needed to reduce the load on the central individual s) to identify other employees  who can share the load in the social network.  </p>

<h3 id="sparseconnections">Sparse Connections</h3>

<p>Fewer connections  i.e., low density) in the network are not  conducive to smooth coordination in teams. To alleviate this problem, a firm could  consider technology solutions such as Corporate Yellow Pages  to improve the  information network) and corporate forums  to improve the access network). These  technology solutions can be augmented with managerial interventions such as  explicit incentives for participating in corporate forums and experts networks,  training and education to increase interpersonal trust, and corporate fairs and  symposia to foster new network connections.  </p>

<h3 id="lowlevelsofaccess">Low levels of Access</h3>

<p>Sparsely connected access networks may indicate a lack of  communication and information processing abilities in the networks. If employees  rely on synchronous media  such as phone and conference calls) for access, it might  considerably delay the ability of people to communicate with each other. If  synchronous media is augmented with asynchronous collaboration technologies  such as workflow systems, blogs and wikis, new channels of communication can  improve the access network. <br>
SNA can be especially useful in selecting influential executives for high-level positions,  identification of task group members for major organizational restructuring efforts, and postP merger activities. <br>
￼
We have focused so far on collaborations within the organizational boundaries. However,  as shown in the collaboration spheres of Figure 1, a large part of collaborative arrangements  happen across organizational boundaries with downstream and upstream business partners.  We will focus on inter-organizational collaborations in the following section.   </p>

<h2 id="interorganizationalcollaborations">Inter-organizational collaborations</h2>

<p>Traditionally, inter-organizational relationships were viewed from a “make or buy”  perspective. This transactional perspective envisioned an arms-length relationship with  partner organizations. Such a narrow view to inter-organizational relationships is no longer  valid. Today’s firms collaborate with partner firms at strategic, tactical, and transactional  levels. In fact, the term Organizational,Eco/systems is increasingly being used to indicate closely  interconnected community of organizations that collaborate through long-term relationships.  These new forms of collaborations can happen through several different arrangements –  strategic partnerships and alliances; long term supply contracts; outsourcing contracts; joint  investments and ventures; marketing alliances; etc. These collaborative partnerships are  intended to reduce risks, better utilize complementary assets, access new markets, and quicken  the pace of industry innovations. Given the use of complex technologies in today’s products  and services, no single firm may have the necessary technology or skill sets to introduce new  products and services at the pace required to maintain its competitive advantage. In this  context, inter-organizational collaborations are emerging as an attractive alternative to pool the  resources of multiple organizations.  </p>

<h2 id="collaborationmodels">Collaboration Models</h2>

<p>Any discussion of long term inter-organizational collaborations must require consideration  of sourcing strategies as well. Several different forms of sourcing strategies can be pursued. All  of these strategies embody the philosophy of reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and  reducing focus on processes that are tangential to the core competency of the firm.  </p>

<p>Several sourcing strategies can be pursued by firms. A sampling of these sourcing models  is listed in Table 5. Outsourcing has clearly evolved from a cost-reduction tactic to a strategic  tool. Given the vast number of options, the strategic decisions related to sourcing today are  about how to source each and every activity within the value chain. </p>

<p>As Friedman mentions in his book, The,World,is,Flat, a key enabler of the evolution of  sourcing models today is IT applications – especially workflow and collaboration applications.  Additionally, the increasing ability of firms to define business processes in standard ways is  enabling them to standardize processes across firms and industries. This naturally leads to  scale economies as individual service providers can build capabilities in specific processes and  provide those services to multiple firms across industries. UPS is a prime example of a firm  that specializes in logistics business processes. UPS provides specialized logistics support  processes for several companies across the world. For example, UPS can manage business  processes related to After Sales Support that include managing returns, supporting field  technicians, recycling, and repairs.  </p>

<p>The UPS After Sales Support Process is an example of Business Process Outsourcing  BPO).  BPO arrangements have exploded in recent years. While BPO started with outsourcing of call  center operations, it now has expanded to include knowledge-based processes such as product  design, marketing, and sales. Many operational processes require IT integration as well to  execute the outsourced business processes. Given the nascent nature of BPO contracts, it is  natural that many BPO arrangements have not been very successful. Among the reasons for  risks of failure include poor definition and understanding of the business process, poor  knowledge transfer, and high employee turnover.</p>

<p>Sourcing Models <br>
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Sourcing Models
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Outsourcing:
￼￼￼￼￼Contracting of services or processes to an outside firm that may otherwise be performed by in-house employees. Outsourcing entered the business lexicon in the ’80s. Outsourcing IT processes at large corporations such as Xerox and GE created the bandwagon effect. As the outsourcing practice has matured over the years, even smaller firms find outsourcing an attractive option for their IT services.
￼￼￼￼￼Offshoring: 
￼Offshoring refers to relocation of business processes, services, or production to another country. While China and India are the most prominent destinations for offshoring, other countries include Malaysia, Czech Republic, Singapore, Philippines, Brazil, Canada, and Poland. Offshoring may include creation of wholly- or partially-owned subsidiary business units as well as contractual arrangements. 
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Insourcing: 
￼￼￼Insourcing involves the use of outside employees  usually from a contracted firm) in services or production or development processes. These outside employees work within the premises of the firm and are under closer supervision of the internal management team. 
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Multisourcing: <br>
￼￼￼￼￼Cohen and Young  2006)12 define multisourcing as “the disciplined provisioning and blending of business and IT services from the optimal set of internal and external providers in the pursuit of business goals.” It advocates a strategic approach to sourcing that goes beyond individual outsourcing decisions. 
￼￼￼ </p>

<h2 id="keyenablersofcollaboration">Key Enablers of Collaboration</h2>

<p>Even when inter-organizational collaborations are conceived at the strategic level,  execution of the strategy determines the payoffs from the relationship. Toyota Corp. is one of  the pioneering companies to create knowledge-sharing networks in the auto industry. Toyota’s  collaboration processes with partner organizations have been extensively studied by industry analysts and academicians to understand the success of their collaboration model. The key  enablers of effective collaboration in the organizational ecosystems include: </p>

<h3 id="sharedpurpose">Shared Purpose</h3>

<p>The partners in the ecosystems should have the same sense of purpose  to openly share knowledge with other firms. This may require some of the larger  organizations within the network to subsidize initial participation to alleviate concerns  of the smaller partners about the utility of sharing their proprietary knowledge within  the network. <br>
Shared purpose in the Toyota network is created through: <br>
• The creation of a Supplier Association that acts as a community forum for social  interactions. 
• A network-level consulting division with the objective of fostering learning and  knowledge sharing among the partner firms. 
• Smaller voluntary groups of suppliers that share a closer set of objectives to improve  productivity and address quality problems. 
• Job rotations for employees of partner firms at the network level. </p>

<h3 id="rulesandnormsforparticipation">Rules and Norms for Participation</h3>

<p>One of the major problems in teams of individuals  or firms is that many may tend to “freePride” on other contributors. Collaboration  networks need to avoid this trap by creating rules and norms that protect the members  against free-riders. The network should not hesitate to remove partner organizations  that violate the norms of participation. <br>
Rules and norms in the Toyota network include: <br>
• Production processes within the Toyota network is not considered proprietary  knowledge. All members have open access to production-related processes and  technologies. 
• Only key product design details are considered proprietary knowledge of individual  firms. 
• Any value appropriated from knowledge transfer resides with the recipient for at  least 1P2 years, with the expectation that the network partners will share the benefits  after the initial period. <br>
3. Cohesive-and Dense Network: It is important to create a network structure that is  resilient in information transfer and collaboration. This means that multiple pathways  should exist between partner organizations. The redundancy of paths helps in rapid  transfer of knowledge. <br>
At Toyota, the networks established at multiple levels  supplier association, smaller  voluntary groups, and network level consulting division) facilitate the creation of a cohesive and dense social network within the ecosystem. The different types of  activities within these networks facilitate sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge. </p>

<h2 id="roleoftechnologyininterorganizationalcollaboration">Role of Technology in Inter-organizational Collaboration</h2>

<p>Technology can play a facilitating role in inter-organizational collaboration. At the same  time, technology implementation and usage in inter-organizational networks is fraught with  pitfalls and risks due to disparate technology platforms and organizational structures.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of collaboration process, collaborative systems can be used  extensively and integrated deeply into the business process or collaborative systems can be  used in a facilitating role for the main business process. Design processes benefit from deep  penetration of collaborative IT systems as these processes are iterative and involve highly  frequent inter-personal collaborations. While supply chain, manufacturing, and logistics  processes require close integration of transactional systems, they may also benefit from  collaborative capabilities that provide information processing and coordination support. These  capabilities enhance the effectiveness of the process integration at the operational levels  between firms.  </p>

<p>Boeing’s use of collaborative technologies to bring together partner firms in its product  design and production efforts is one illustration of the successful use of IT in collaborative ecoP systems14. Boeing uses Catia V5, CAD software from Dassault systems of Germany, to connect  hundreds of partner organizations. Boeing requires that all partner firms use the same  software and the same version for easy exchange of information. Boeing also requires that  every person  from any firm) involved in the design effort receive software updates at the  same time. These updates involve over 100 applications used in the design process. A data  warehouse for storing design and engineering information is also created. Partner firms  upload their design changes on a periodic basis so that the latest designs are available to the  entire team. </p>

<p>The standardized Collaborative,Planning,,Forecasting,and,Replenishment  CPFR) process in  retail supply chains is an instance illustrating how IT support for information processing is  helpful. Inventory management in the retail industry’s supply chains is a fairly complex  process. The uncertainties in customer demand faced by downstream partners get amplified as  the information is processed upstream in the supply chain. This causes each upstream partner  to carry higher levels of inventory  i.e., “safety stock”). Clearly, this is insufficient as the costs  of carrying excess inventory is eventually incurred by everyone involved. To help alleviate the  forecasting and planning problems in retail supply chains, the CPFR process lays out a  standard set of activities for supply chain collaborators  more details on the CPFR process is  available at: <a href="http://www.vics.org/committees/cpfr/">http://www.vics.org/committees/cpfr/</a> ). Managers in the supply chain have to  continuously collaborate and exchange information on plans, forecasts, store promotions,  orders, lead times, and deliveries. Typically, a retail store would have hundreds of store  locations, carry several hundred SKU  stock carrying units), and manage several distribution  centers and warehouses.  </p>

<p>Collaborative systems in such situations provide information processing support. For  example, an exception event  a new promotion) can cause a change in the order placement  plans of the retailer. In these cases, collaboration systems can help supply chain partners by  alerting them to misalignment in plans and forecasts. The exception alerts can focus the  collaborative efforts on the exception events and help reduce the information burden on the  managers. </p>

<p>The process change pitfalls we discussed in the first module apply in the implementation of  collaboration systems as well. In an inter-organizational context, the pitfall risks are elevated  due to the confluence of multiple organizations in the collaboration network. These pitfalls are  listed below.</p>

<p>• Resistance – Disagreements over the process change decisions and/or process design  that cause the process change effort to stall. 
• Inertia – Lack of progress on the process change effort despite  supposed)  agreement on the process design details. 
• Misspecification – Making incorrect process design decisions, creating a process or  technology that “works” but is a misfit. 
Once a new process design is rolled out, there is a danger that we encounter two  additional pitfalls: <br>
• Misuse – Improper employment of a new technology/process; in a sense, sabotaging  the process design through creation of informal and undocumented processes and  workarounds. 
• Nonuse'– Lack of adoption of the process or technology; this behavior especially  manifests when employees perceive the process or technology as discretionary. 
The following key points should be considered and agreed upon when implementing  collaborative technologies in inter-organizational contexts: <br>
• Is their prior agreement on the use of the system among partner organizations? 
• Do all members have access to the same version of the technology platform? 
• Who is responsible for providing training and support? 
• How are the costs of implementing and maintaining the system shared across  partner organizations? 
• If disputes arise in the use and performance of the system, what is the process used  for resolving the disputes? 
• Who retains data ownership in the collaboration system? If it is shared, what are the  standards for use and dissemination of information? 
• If the system can have widespread use in the industry, can the process and  technology features be adopted as an industry standard  much like CPFR)?  </p>

<h2 id="examplesofinnovativecollaborationmodels">Examples of Innovative Collaboration Models</h2>

<p>Collaborations between firms need not always be based on technology integration or  technology usage. A few such examples of innovative collaborations are discussed below. <br>
Netbank was an Internet-only bank that had no physical branches  unfortunately, this bank  went bankrupt in 2007 in the wake of the mortgage crisis)15. Most of its retail customers had to  use pre-paid envelopes to deposit checks. The cycle time to complete the deposit transactions  used to be around 7 days. The process was also expensive for NetBank as it paid for postage  and envelope costs. While using ATMs from other banks was an option, it would have been  cost0-prohibitive for NetBank to refund transaction charges to its customers for deposits.  NetBank also considered the other costly option of investing in a network of ATM machines.  In looking for ideal locations to put the teller machines, it began talking to UPS. UPS had a  network of over 3500 retail stores across America. However, it was not interested in hosting  ATMs in its retail stores. Eventually, the two firms came up with an interesting solution: Bank  customers could go to any UPS store and drop their deposit envelopes and obtain a receipt.  The UPS store, at the end of the day, would consolidate all the envelopes and overnight it to  NetBank’s processing center. The arrangement benefited both UPS and NetBank. NetBank  could process deposits in two days instead of the normal seven days. UPS would also benefit  from the increased foot-traffic to its retail store. This arrangement needed no IT integration or  collaboration technologies!  </p>

<p>The Chinese motorcycle industry is an example of successful modularization of product  development and production16. The Chinese motorcycle industry is concentrated in the city of  Chongqing. The industry consists of several hundred loosely coupled firms that coordinate to  design and produce motorcycles and motorcycle components. The firms involved in the  network collaboratively modify the specifications to make rapid improvements in product  design. Since the firms are co-located in the same city, there are ample opportunities for faceP to-face interactions for testing out the design ideas. These loosely-coupled collaborations in the  industry have been spectacularly successful. Chinese-manufactured motorcycle sales have  grown from 5 million in 1997 to over 21 million in 2006. <br>
As technology takes center stage with the widespread acceptance of e-business, it is  increasingly the case that IT standards become both a facilitator and, in some cases, the very  subject of e-business. In today’s business environment the need for developing widelyP accepted rules of engagement or standards for technology is principally to facilitate  interoperability among information products and services. However, standards-setting  processes involve interactions between firms with often conflicting objectives. In addition,  standards-setting processes are massive collaboration efforts – in all over 520 organizations  have been identified by XML.ORG, an independent industry group that keeps track of  ongoing XML standardization efforts. As active players attempt to influence XML-based eP business standards for specific industries and in the cross industry contexts, the group of firms engaged in creating and promoting standards use a variety of media to collaborate and resolve  conflicts. Collaboration processes include participation in industry consortia, face-to-face  meetings and teleconferences, and online discussion groups. A close examination of the social  networks formed in the standards bodies reveals a robust community of subject matter experts  who have built lasting social networks. These experts often share a common vision for the  evolution of the e-business industry and associated technologies. </p>

<h2 id="masscollaboration">MassCollaboration</h2>

<p>Mass collaboration is a logical extension of inter-personal and inter-organizational  collaborations. It is perhaps the most exciting new development in recent years – it has lifted  the gloomy mood in the IT industry with some exciting prospects for increasing the customer  experience.  </p>

<p>Interactions in a mass collaboration setting are termed as peer/to/peer. Basically, the  communities formed through mass collaborations are forums for individuals to interact with  each other. In most cases, these individuals do not belong to any specific entities or  organizations. New Web 2.0 technologies have been instrumental in creating these  communities. In Table 6, a number of prominent mass collaboration environments and  communities are listed.  </p>

<p>￼￼￼The emerging mass collaboration models pose a number of intriguing questions and issues  that have both business and societal implications. We will explore these and the following  issues in this section: </p>

<ol>
<li>Given the lack of explicit incentives at the outset, it appears that mass collaboration  environments would be hard pressed to survive and sustain. Surprisingly, these  environments not only have shown resiliency, they have also grown at a spectacular rate in the past few years. We will explore the underlying phenomenon of mass  collaboration communities.  </li>
<li>A number of firms have begun to exploit the untapped potential of open communities.  How do they do it? And what are the ramifications?  </li>
<li>A number of firms have begun to embark on building internal communities modeled  upon Web 2.0 mass collaborations. Can these so-called “Enterprise 2.0” initiatives thrive  inside corporate walls?  </li>
<li>A number of firms have begun to create customer-facing communities to provide  resources pertaining to product knowledge and after-sales issues. Both employees and  knowledgeable customers participate as “experts” in these forums. Can these  communities sustain? What are the prerequisites to running such corporate focused  communities? </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sustainingandgrowingpeercommunities">Sustaining and Growing Peer Communities</h3>

<p>In the ’90s, Internet usage grew rapidly as the number of servers and clients connected to it  exponentially increased. Interestingly, none of the growth was really planned – we “selfP organized” into a massive community for information-sharing within a short amount of time.  In a similar way, peer communities for mass collaborations are “self-organizing.” This would  imply that mass collaboration is inherently a messy and random process. This indeed was the  initial thought-process related to Internet growth. <br>
More recently, however, we are beginning to unearth patterns in how the Internet has  inherently self-organized in a systematic fashion  at least from the perspective of the  connections between web pages). Among the earliest works, Barabasi and Albert  1999)  showed that the pattern of connectivity between pages on the WWW follows a power-law  distribution17. If one were to go with the initial assumption that the pages are connected to  each other in a random fashion, then the distribution of the number of connections per page  should be even  i.e., each page is equally likely to be connected to any other page). However,  what really emerged is that a very small percentage of the pages had a very large number of  connections and a very large percentage of the pages had very few connections. This follows  what is called a power law distribution  see Figure 8).</p>

<p>What this implies is that as the WWW grew, the new pages were likely to be designed in  such a way that they linked to pages which already had a large number of connections.  Interestingly, this is how many social networks behave. People desire to create connections  with those who already are well-connected. A side benefit is that the number of links that we  must go through to reach a random node can be reduced considerably. This is why human  networks are termed “small-world networks.” It takes an incredibly small number of links to  connect one person to any random person in the country! </p>

<p>￼￼ 
Many social networking sites try to take advantage of this phenomenon. For example,  LinkedIn can build a remarkably close-knit community through their social networking  model. The effectiveness of the network grows as the number of people who signPin grows as  well. </p>

<p>So, how does the “small-world network” connect to mass collaboration communities? It  turns out that even content contributions and subscriptions follow the “small-world” pattern.  For example, the contribution to readership ratio on Wikipedia is very low, i.e., a very small  percentage of users contribute and a very large percentage of readers benefit! According to  Wikipedia founder, Jimmy Wales, 10 percent of all users make 80  of all edits; 5 percent of all  users make 66  of edits; half of all edits are made by just 2 1⁄2  of all users. So, power-law  distribution still rules.  </p>

<p>A low threshold level of contribution creates additional incentives for participants. For  example, in open source software development communities, users can contribute by either  submitting code changes or by contributing bug reports. A very small percentage of users  contribute to code changes because of the high threshold level  aka scale-free pattern).  However, a larger percentage of users report bugs because of the low threshold level for  contribution. <br>
Similarly, on social bookmarking sites, there is a low threshold level for participation – you  simply need to contribute a bookmark. On Wikipedia, there is a lower level threshold for  doing minor edits  for example, correcting spelling mistakes, adding a sentence or two to  complete the article). Therefore, a larger number of contributors are seen to play the role of “editors” and “synthesizers,” a smaller number of contributors actually need to create “new”  articles.  </p>

<p>So, for a collaborative community to be successful, it is important to have a large user base.  Even if a small number of these users are contributors, the community can be sustainable. The  long tail in the power law distribution is the “lurker” population – but it is an integral part of  the community as it keeps the community vibrant. Without this community, the small set of  contributors could get discouraged. If possible, a low threshold level for participation is  desirable. If not, the community should be set up to allow for multiple levels of participation  so that contributors can self-organize at the levels they are willing to participate. </p>

<h3 id="crowdsourcing">Crowd sourcing</h3>

<p>The Open Source Software  OSS) community is a peculiar phenomenon. It is a seemingly  unrelated set of people who may have never met, gathering in digital space to build fairly  complex software products  including operating systems, browsers, and server applications).  Commercially-equivalent products of this nature are built by corporations that employ  hundreds of highly-paid programmers and systems architects and spend millions of dollars in  design and development. <br>
While the open source movement creates a number of interesting societal questions on  intellectual property rights, it also brings forth the vast potential and abilities of self-organized,  openPended communities to carry out intellectually-complex projects. Many firms have begun  to utilize open source communities and even encourage their employees to contribute and  participate in creating new products. Firms like IBM and Redhat generate revenue from  providing complementary services and support for open source products. Interestingly, the  open source model is being extended in unexpected ways by some firms in other industries.  Jeff Howe  <a href="http://crowdsourcing.com">http://crowdsourcing.com</a>) defines crowd sourcing as “nthe act of taking a job  traditionally performed by a designated agent  usually an employee) and outsourcing it to an  undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call.n Or “the application of  Open Source principles to fields outside of software.” A sampling of crowd sourcing  approaches used by NetFlix, Innocentive.com, Rentacoder.com, and GoldCorp are an indicator  of the future of collaboration in corporate settings. <br>
• NetFlix, an online, DVD rental company that has challenged the statusPquo of the  storePbased DVD rental business dominated by Blockbuster. At the heart of  NetFlix’s business strategy is its ability to predict whether a customer would like or  not like a movie. The Cinematch recommendation system that NetFlix uses mines  millions of movie rentals to come up with accurate predictions. Obviously, NetFlix  wants these predictions to be as accurate as possible. While it continues to work on  improving its prediction algorithm, it also threw a challenge in 2006 to the outside  world to improve upon the prediction accuracy. The “NetFlix Prize”   <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/index">http://www.netflixprize.com/index</a>) promised to award $1 Million to anyone who  improved the prediction accuracy by at least 10  over Cinematch’s current  capabilities. It provided a training dataset of actual movie rentals from its data warehouse for contestants to test their algorithm. At the beginning of 2008, there  were 30,056 registered contestants on 24,000 teams from 167 different countries.  Over 20,000 valid submissions were received from 2876 different teams. These teams  were been able to improve upon prediction accuracy by over 8   as against the goal  for grand prize – 10 ). NetFlix also awarded $50,000 for a team that was first to  reach a target rate of accuracy set for the year. The winning team for the $1 million  prize was a group of employees from AT&amp;T Research Labs! 
• Innocentive.com is an open innovation community that won the Economist  magazine’s “Business Process Award.” Innocentive.com has created a marketplace  for firms to expand their R&amp;D capabilities by reaching out to a vast network of  researchers and experts all around the world. As an intermediary, Innocentive.com  manages the intellectual property transfer issues for the solvers and seeking firms.  Firms that announce a challenge associate an award amount for the solver.

Over 125,000 solvers are registered on Innocentive.com from highly  scientific and specialized fields such as chemistry, life sciences, and physical  sciences. Several major companies including Boeing, Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly and  Company, and Procter &amp; Gamble post challenges regularly on Innocentive.com. <br>
• Rentacoder.com is the ebay equivalent of software programming services.  Rentacoder.com allows buyers to post programming problems or systems  development project requests online. Nearly 200,000 registered programmers on the  site can bid for these projects. As in ebay, programmers and buyers build reputation  scores over time. Buyers can place their requests for free and once they accept a bid  can place the negotiated amount in an escrow account. The programmer will get  paid once they complete the systems development. Most of the requests are for  projects that would be too small to be contracted to outsourcing companies. Many of  the programmers are from low-cost countries. To maintain a sustainable community  of programmers and buyers, Rentacoder.com publishes top programmer lists and  Expert Guarantee features  aka a certification program). <br>
Rentacoder.com is not without competition. Topcoder.com is another firm that uses  the crowd sourcing strategy with a different twist. Topcoder.com uses weekly  competitions to rate its base of thousands of software developers around the world.  Only those who qualify are eligible for working on projects. Topcoder.com uses a  specialized methodology to build software by drawing from the army of qualified  developers around the world. Each project is divided into smaller parts and opened  up as a competition for its developer community. The best solution is selected from  the pool of solutions provided by the developers. Topcoder.com then assembles the  final project by integrating the different components together. <br>
• GoldCorp is a Canadian Gold Mining Corporation. Goldcorp in 1999 faced a tough  problem – its 50PyearPold mine in Red Lake, Ontario was facing high costs and  depleting gold deposits. While some test drilling at remote sites revealed possibly  rich deposits of gold, the firm’s geologists were unable to accurately estimate the  amount of gold deposits and the exact locations. The CEO of GoldCorp CEO at that  time, Rob McEwen, surprised everyone by releasing the geological data to the entire  world under the “GoldCorp Challenge”  <a href="http://www.goldcorpchallenge.com/">http://www.goldcorpchallenge.com/</a>).  Several submissions came in from around the world that identified over a 100 areas  for possible exploration. A substantial number of the identified areas yielded gold.  Between 2000 and 2001, gold production increased by nearly 500  in the Red Lake  area. The top four finalists in the competition were awarded $325,000. <br>
While these success stories point to the advantages of crowd sourcing, there are also  troubling issues that managers have to be aware of when embarking on this business model.  First, there is an element of exploitation that one has to carefully address. The competitions  may appear to exploit individuals’ time and effort, especially when the competition reward  and resulting benefits to the firm are not well-matched. Second, as more firms follow the  crowd sourcing model, the novelty of the approach may wear out and thus may possibly  diminish the quality of the final solutions. Finally, when customer data is released, firms may  inadvertently breach privacy rules and standards. For example, when AOL released its  customer search queries database, it inadvertently revealed embarrassing details about  individual customers  not surprisingly, search patterns over time by the same customer  reveals a lot about that customer – a customer may use his/her own name and address as a  search term at some point in time and he/she also may search for information on medical  conditions. When these different search queries are combined, a profile of that customer with a  rich set of personal information can be created.). Even when customer data is not involved,  other data released as part of the competition may contain sensitive corporate data that can be  exploited by competing firms.  </p>

<h3 id="enterprise20">Enterprise 2.0</h3>

<p>Many firms have begun to use mass collaboration technologies and processes internally.  Some have begun to use the term Enterprise'2.0 to refer to a new set of collaborative processes  and technologies adapted from the more popularlyPused Web 2.0 collaboration technologies.  These technologies include instant messaging, blogs, and wikis.  </p>

<p>At the outset, mass collaboration internal to the organization requires a change in mindset.  It is hard to imagine the entire organization collaborating on projects in a self-organized  manner. So how exactly can mass collaboration be achieved? We mentioned that the power  law distribution is one of the underlying reasons that a large base of users can self-organize to  peer-produce content. However, corporate divisions do not have a large base of employees.  They are also governed by a different set of norms and practices. Corporate employees have  accountability – their contributions would be judged more closely by their managers and  peers. While peer producers can self-organize and do not have any internal deadlines to work with, corporate employees constantly juggle with multiple responsibilities and deadlines.  Therefore it is not easy to assume that mass collaboration processes and technologies can be  easily adapted inside corporate settings. Any implementation of Web 2.0 technologies and  processes should justify the investments in time and money. <br>
Some examples of mass collaboration tools inside corporations have begun to emerge.  These early efforts show promising new ways through which new forms of collaboration  models can be defined inside the organization. <br>
• The'Geek'Squad division within Best Buy generates over $1 billion in revenues  through customized computer services for individual consumers in the US. The  computer services personnel in Geek Squad use many different types of  collaboration tools. Given that these personnel are technology savvy, their methods  of collaboration are unique. As the division grew from 60 to over 10,000 employees,  Geek Squad members used online games such as Battlefield 2 to stay in touch. While  playing games, these members exchanged valuable tips and tricks related to their  work18. At the same time, a corporate-sponsored wiki system was very slow to take  off within the organization. The success of the selfP-rganized network in Geek  Squad has encouraged Best Buy to try new forms of bottomPup collaborations in its  retail division through initiatives such as leadership forums that gather customer  insights from frontline employees. <br>
• DrKW  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein) is an investment bank based in London.  The bank has experimented extensively with wikis and blogs in its internal  processes19. While the initial use of wikis and blogs began in the IT division, it has  been slowly expanded to include the bank’s main business divisions as well. The IT  division uses wikis mainly to manage meeting minutes, document procedures and  how-tos, and create presentations. The firm has found that it is important to create  some initial content to guide users in the beginning and then let the employees selfP organize the content in their own way through an adaptive process. Over 2500  employees use the wikis and blogs regularly. Interestingly, to promote widespread  use of blogs, the firm included a link to the employee blogs inside the Outlook  contact information in the same way that phone and fax numbers are included. <br>
• Angel.com is a subsidiary of MicroStrategy that provides interactive voice response  and call center solutions. Angel.com used wikis initially to handle project  management-related collaborations. The use spread slowly to other divisions  including marketing and operations staff. For instance, marketing groups used wikis  to share market research information; operations staff used wikis to share product  upgrade schedules.
￼￼
A survey of Web 2.0 usage in corporations discovered the following processes that  benefited from the use of Web 2.0 based processes20: <br>
• Software Development 
• E-learning 
• Project Management 
• Posting general Information  • User Groups 
• Ad-hoc Collaboration  • Tech Support 
• Resource Management  • R&amp;D 
As with Web 2.0 usage in consumer-oriented websites, different levels of participation have  been observed in this survey. As shown in Figure 9, the survey by Majchrzak et al.,  2006)  identifies user participation at different levels of contribution intensity. <br>
￼
For sustained use of Web 2.0 tools inside the corporation one would therefore need clear  incentives for participation. Engaging users in time-constrained project management situations  actually creates a setting where incentives to participate in the collaborative environment is  high. In these settings, we would not necessarily see the manifestation of power-law  distribution, and yet see a successful collaboration effort. However, when Web 2.0 is used in  settings where there are no explicit time constraints  such as for tech support, R&amp;D, and adP hoc collaborations), larger groups will have a higher likelihood of successful implementation  of Web 2.0 collaboration tools. </p>

<p>Fostering'Customer:Facing'Communities' <br>
Corporations have begun to utilize Web 2.0 technologies to create and foster customer  communities. If utilized well, these communities can be great customer-retention mechanisms.  The spirit of the approach is captured well by a recent post by Dell Corporation on its website: <br>
Customers helping customers is something that we encourage at Dell and wikis are one of the ways we're pursuing that goal. We will be launching our first customer-facing wiki later this month, ... We'll be monitoring the wiki’s effectiveness closely as we determine how best to take advantage of this technology in other areas. We’ll use wiki technology internally to make our processes more efficient for our teams and we will continue to expand our internal wikis in the coming year. We are also looking at better leveraging the community knowledge in the Dell Community Forums to allow our customers to more easily find the solutions they need. We are considering the idea of creating individual wikis with the knowledge distilled from threads in forum conversations. <br>
–From Dell.com  4/19/07) <a href="http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/62156">http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/62156</a></p>

<p>Clearly, the viability of customer communities is based on product characteristics as well as  corporate image. Complex products benefit from customer-centric communities. This is  especially so when a highly-knowledgeable base of customers already exists. Online games,  computers, puzzles and games, and photography are examples of complex product  environments that already have a mass community of expert-users who share information and  tips with their peers. They also help out “newbies” in troubleshooting. </p>

<p>A sample set of corporations using customer-centric wikis is mentioned in Table 4. These  are sites that the product or service firms own and operate. There are also a number of  collaboration sites that operate independently from the connected firms and yet are entirely  devoted to the product. For example, www.hardforum.com operates a number of forums for  computer components; www.howardforum.com operates a number of forums for cell phone  users. The users on these sites have developed their own set of norms on how to communicate.  A community norm on hardforum.com is for posters to list the products and components they  currently use in their signatures. Users can also be harsh on any posters who “pose” expertise.  Real expertise is highly valued – longtime posters often maintain their own blogs to keep a  current list of tips and tricks for specific components or gadgets. </p>

<p>One of the challenges to running a customer-centric wiki is the lack of control on content. If  a firm owns the site and begins to delete posts for a variety of reasons, it can backfire. At the  same time, it is counterproductive to retain information and posts that are inflammatory or  inaccurate. Managing this delicate balance can be time-consuming and expensive. This is one  of the reasons that independent product forums have been more successful. In fact, some firms  encourage their employees to participate in these forums to provide additional information. <br>
Firms also need to design mechanisms to align incentives. Some firms have experimented  with creation of micro-payment or credit systems to encourage users to post solutions or help  other customers. The credits accumulated over time can be used towards buying new  products. Lego  a maker of interlocking plastic blocks) has been experimenting with customerP generated ideas for quite sometime. Lego has created a software tool called Mindstorms for  users to create their own toy robots. Once a user builds a design for a robot, they can even post  their programs online for other customers to use. Lego has extended this concept further to  allow users to assemble custom kits of Lego blocks. In fact, other customers can also purchase  the custom kit once the customer shares the design voluntarily on the site. <br>
Mass collaboration is an exciting development. As with any new technology or platform,  there is considerable amount of enthusiasm among users to produce, share, and consume  content online. It is important to know that there is some amount of skepticism on the  sustainability and value of mass collaboration. First, quality of available content is an issue of  concern. Given the vast number of blogs that exist today on the WWW, it is natural that there  are many blogs that are of dubious quality. Second, validity and accuracy of the content cannot  always be verified or assumed. These two concerns should at least cause readers to critically  review the content before accepting its validity or accuracy. Yet, these concerns have always  been around even in print media. Additionally, the higher quality content is more likely to  receive higher visibility through the “small-worlds” phenomenon. The better content is more  likely to be cited and quoted often, and it is also likely to link to other content on the web –  and show up first on search engine results.  </p>

<h3 id="modulesummary">ModuleSummary</h3>

<p>As indicated early on in this course, business processes and strategies should be foremost  in our thoughts when we consider technology solutions. The course modules were designed to  emphasize the understanding of technology use in the context of business needs. </p>

<p>Despite the dot.com bust, technology innovation is still thriving. The developments in the  Web 2.0 space are a testament to the vibrant innovative community that is redefining business  models and social interactions. The unrelenting rise in computing, communication, and  storage power continues to create opportunities for new ways of analyzing information and  create opportunities to create new technology-enabled business models. <br>
Technology also has a disruptive influence on markets and industries. Collaborative  technologies are allowing firms to innovate on their sourcing models. These new sourcing  models are not only enabling firms to execute their processes globally; they are also creating entirely new markets for their products and services. Consequently, IT is too important a topic  to be ignored by managers. <br>
New technologies and terminologies can often be confusing and daunting for non-technical  managers who tend to delegate technology decisions to their IT departments. So the main  objective of this course was to provide a business context for prominent technologies in the  marketplace today. Once managers realize that they can approach technology solutions by first  identifying and exploring the business imperatives, they can better communicate to the  technical staff on the technology requirements. This way, both technology and business  executives can collaborate more closely to create value for the firm and its customers. </p>

Yet at the same time, reports began to emerge as to how some organizations were able to reap enormous benefits from their IT investments. A common theme in these organizations was that these IT investments were accompanied by changes in the design of their business processes. This realization created increased focus on cross-functional business process redesign, beginning in the mid-80s.</p>

<p>Since then, our ability to design and implement IT-enabled process oriented organizations has considerably evolved over the past three decades. More importantly, IT initiatives related to Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Business Process Management (BPM) systems are predicated on the existence of well-designed business processes. However, the task of designing processes has become harder due to the disappearance of boundaries both within and across enterprises.</p>

<p>Therefore, the main objective of this module is to impart sufficient understanding of the issues we encounter in evaluating, designing, and implementing IT-enabled business processes. It builds the foundation for process analysis by focusing on key aspects of business processes including collaboration, information flow, people, roles, and business rules. The module also provides an overview of techniques and tools of process analysis and workflow (i.e., a set of interconnected tasks) management including process mapping techniques and simulation <br>

<h2 id="informationsystemsandbusinessprocesses">Information Systems and Business Processes</h2>

<p><a href="http://pompeiiconsulting.com/strategic-alignment/" target="_blank">Porter’s value chain model</a> can be a useful framework for understanding the role of information systems and business processes in organizations. Porter’s value chain defines a set of interconnected activities that create and deliver products and services to customers. The value chain model identifies two classes of activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Primary activities – inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and after sales services.</li>
<li>Support activities – administrative infrastructure, human resources management, research &amp; product development, and procurement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these activities requires processing of information (collection and storage, analytics, and dissemination) and therefore information systems are ubiquitous in each of the activities. For example, ERP systems support a number of activities in both support and primary categories. However, it is rare to see ERP systems supporting R&amp;D or product development efforts. SCM systems primarily span inbound logistics, operations, and some outbound logistics activities, while CRM systems primarily support marketing, sales, and service activities.</p>

<p>An important takeaway from the value chain perspective is that business processes (i.e., value chain activities) drive organizational performance. Information systems support and optimize these processes. However, for information systems to create business value, it becomes imperative that the business process context is understood and appropriately utilized when designing, configuring or implementing information systems.</p>

<p>Information systems can create business value in a number of ways. Information systems can automate routine tasks in business processes so that employees are free to do more cognitively-complex tasks that create value. Using workflow management systems one can divide business process tasks into discrete steps and then electronically coordinate the various steps performed by different employees or organizations. Workflow management systems enable organizations to overcome time and location constraints in coordination. Information systems enable collaboration within groups and across firms. Web-based collaboration technologies such as Instant Messengers (IM), email, wikis, and blogs greatly enhance our ability to communicate and collaborate. </p>

<p>Information systems can allow for centralized control of business process execution. When processes can be monitored centrally, it is possible to achieve process standardization across geographic and functional boundaries. If judicially implemented, standardized processes create flexibility in workforce deployment. <br>
These different capabilities of information systems enable firms to strategically think of new business models and processes that add value to customer experiences with the firm.</p>

<h3 id="historicalbackground">Historical Background</h3>

<p>The business ideas marketplace is replete with buzzwords and cure-alls. Each new idea, however, has left an undeniable mark on how organizations are structured and work. In fact, many new ideas are a synthesis of well-known past ideas which needed a fresh perspective. Business Process orientation is one of those ideas that borrows from well-known disciplines and management ideas of the past. We can go all the way back to the 1890s to see the genesis of ideas related to process optimization. Frederick Taylor, known as the father of Scientific Management, was one of the first to propose systematic methods of work processes1. His methodology advocated a step-by-step observational and experimentation approach to evaluate the efficiency of work processes (in the labor-intensive manufacturing contexts of that era). Information gathered from the observations and experiments were then used to redesign and improve the process. Taylor also proposed the use of incentives and bonuses as a way to reward employees for efficient work.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma approaches gained popularity, especially in the auto industry. Both of these approaches stressed the need to systematically assess manufacturing and service processes to reduce errors and increase quality awareness to improve customer satisfaction. Six Sigma is a data driven methodology that continuously assesses process output and investigates ways to bring the process quality to a level where practically every output item would meet the specification. For example, a Six Sigma manufacturing process would produce less than 3.4 defects per million parts.</p>

<p>Hammer and Champy2 – the main proponents of “Business Process Reengineering” – defined process reengineering as a “Radical redesign of broad, cross-functional business processes with the objective of order-of-magnitude performance gains, often with the aid of information technology.” While TQM and Six Sigma approaches focus on improving quality and efficiencies of individual tasks, process reengineering takes a broader look at the organization structure and encourages managers to question whether a task adds business value. Hammer and Champy consider IT to be a central part of the reengineering strategy as it can fundamentally change the way we do our work. Many of the popular early reengineering success stories were successful IT projects that had been retro-fitted to the ideas and principles of process reengineering.</p>

<p>Yet a major difficulty in creating process-oriented enterprises is that it is difficult to identify business processes. This difficulty arises because many of today’s business processes have evolved over time – no one consciously “designed” them. Therefore, a big first step for many organizations is to determine what business processes already exist. But to discover them, we need to first define what they are. As you will see in the next section, there is quite a bit of variation in business processes that makes it hard to come up with a single, comprehensive definition of a business process.</p>

<h2 id="definitionofabusinessprocess">Definition of a Business Process</h2>

<p>A business process can be defined as a set of connected tasks initiated in response to an event, achieving a specific result for the customer and other stakeholders3. The focus on a trigger event is important. The work we do in organizations is mostly caused by an event: a customer has placed an order, a desktop computer has crashed, and a need to start a new advertising and promotion campaign has arisen. In response to the trigger event, a series of tasks are executed. The end result of the series of tasks is the process outcome.</p>

<p>While this definition seems simple enough, there are many ways managers stumble in defining the end-to-end series of tasks and events, even for simple processes. Difficulties become most obvious when we want to define process metrics to measure the outcomes. For example, how we define on-time airline performance depends on whose perspective is being considered. If it is an airline passenger’s point of view, it may be the time elapsed from entering the plane to claiming baggage and leaving the airport. From a pilot’s perspective, it may be the amount of time it takes for the aircraft to become airborne and land at its destination. From the airport’s standpoint, the time between the aircraft’s gate departure to becoming airborne could be the main focus. So, for the same process, each stakeholder has a different perspective of performance. However, the stakeholders collectively would be responsible for the end-to-end process performance from the customer’s perspective.</p>

<p>In general, consider that a process:</p>

<ul>
<li>is outcome oriented; you should be able to identify the output.
Examples: The product development process ideally results in a new product introduction while the order fulfillment process delivers a finished product or service to the customer.  </li>
<li>is for a customer and has stakeholders.
External stakeholders are the customers and investors. Processes can have internal stakeholders as well, such as employees; often, regulation processes include government agencies as stakeholders.  </li>
<li>has a trigger event.
A customer calling in with an order would trigger the order fulfillment process. A <br>
seller posting an item to auction triggers an instance of the auction process on E-bay.  </li>
<li>is a collection of interrelated tasks.
An auction process involves posting an item, a number of bid instances over the auction duration, followed by identification of the winner at the end of the auction duration. Shipping the item to the winner and receipt of the payment completes the auction process.  </li>
<li>is not a function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often managers confuse functional (i.e., departmental) boundaries as process boundaries. But this is a misconception; process boundaries frequently span functional areas. The accounting function is not a process; however, receiving amounts due, paying amounts due, and reimbursing travel expenses are processes within the accounting department.</p>

<p>Alternative Definitions <br>
The definition in the previous section encompasses many business processes that have a transactional- or workflow-oriented structure. But workflow orientation does not completely cover all the different types of business processes one encounters in today’s organizations. Business process outcomes that are heavily impacted by collaboration and communications do not nicely fit into this definition. So the following alternative definition of business process seeks to address this deficiency.</p>

<p>A process is any work that is recurrent; affects organizational capabilities; contributes to cost, value, service, or quality; and requires coordination.</p>

<p>More broadly, based on the nature of work, processes can be classified into three broad classes: Transactional, Collaborative, and Iterative. Table 1 provides a summary of features for these three types of business processes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Transactional processes have a clear, structured workflow orientation; are very operationally oriented through well-defined inputs and outcomes; and generally have a short time span (a few minutes to a few days). The main focus of the analysis in reengineering these types of processes is task structure.</li>
<li>Collaborative processes are team oriented; have limited structure in the way work is done (i.e., work may be assigned in an ad-hoc fashion); and have a longer time span (typically from a few days to a few months). The main focus of analysis in reengineering collaborative processes is communications and collaborations among team members.</li>
<li>Iterative processes are accomplished by large teams (they may be geographically dispersed). These processes may include a combination of transactional and collaborative processes. The main focus of analysis in reengineering iterative processes is the flow of information between teams and minimizing re-work.

<h2 id="designingabusinessprocess">Designing a Business Process</h2>

<p>Designing a business process requires a careful understanding of many aspects of the organization and process. Business processes often cut across multiple functional organizations (i.e., departments) and hierarchies within and outside the organization; therefore, the process must be well coordinated to achieve the business goals effectively. Coordination is simplest when the organization is divided into functional groups that do not share resources, products, or markets. Unfortunately, such a scenario is rarely seen in contemporary business organizations.</p>

<p>Given the complexity of a business process, achieving appropriate level of coordination requires a multi-pronged approach to understanding the operational core of the business process. Academic and practitioner research in this area has identified the workflow structure, information systems, business rules, and motivation structure as major components of the operational core (see Figure 2). These four aspects of a business process address different design features, but all four aspects need to be well-coordinated to achieve success.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Operational Core of a Business Process <br>
Workflow Execution <br>
Activities and precedence relationships among the activities together form the workflow structure of a business process. Workflow can be predominantly sequential at one extreme and predominantly parallel at the other.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequential interdependence occurs when one activity/process is directly dependent on another for its inputs or resources. An assembly line is a typical example of sequential interdependence.</li>
<li>Parallel workflow structure (or concurrent interdependence) on the other hand is characterized by execution of tasks simultaneously. Such interdependence can be seen in workflow structures of firefighting or race pit stops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Process designers typically focus on reducing handoffs, increasing concurrency, or increasing automated tasks within the process to enhance workflow efficiency. Workflow optimization efforts focus on achieving excellence in execution of routine tasks and thereby achieve efficiencies. Inherent in routine activities is the repeated interaction of employees over time with the business environment. Therefore, knowledge synthesis in a workflow context arises from systematic discovery of repeating patterns and creating a set of activities to optimally address those repeating patterns. Flexibility in workflow can be achieved through a cross-trained workforce. However, differing skill levels among employees can conflict with the goals of achieving efficiencies.</p>

<h3 id="informationsystems">Information Systems</h3>

<p>Information processing infrastructure in business processes is designed to minimize computation, acquisition, and communication costs (all three put together would be termed as the coordination costs of information processing). The design imperative is information coordination; that is, getting the right information to the right person at the right time to produce the right processed information. Information systems have the twin effect of increasing the role of middle managers in process management as well as enhancing the decision making process by helping people do higher quality work.</p>

<p>Information coordination is of utmost importance in processes that execute on a periodic basis such as project planning, budgeting, strategic planning, product design, and so forth. Such processes often lack the rich patterns of learning that could be obtained in a transactional business process. As such, information systems can enhance information coordination by focusing on storing documents, reports, and computational aids (e.g., spreadsheet models in project evaluation processes) to reduce the cognitive burden on knowledge workers.</p>

<h3 id="businessrules">Business Rules</h3>

<p>Business rules constitute the decision-making component of a process. In this context, the workflow execution steps are really a set of actions that interpret and implement business rules. Business rules are intended to guide and constrain the actions of the employees (or agents) in the day-to-day execution of the business process. Business rules can be both informal (i.e., unstated rules of business) and formal (e.g., policy manuals, or rules embedded in information systems). When a process is analyzed in-depth, informal rules can be discovered and embedded into the information systems. The extraction of business rules helps in training and cross-training of employees and builds flexibility into the process.</p>

<h3 id="motivationstructure">Motivation Structure</h3>

<p>More often than not, individual employees’ objectives and interests can be different from process objectives. Organizational culture, performance metrics, and incentive mechanisms are effective means to align process objectives with that of the individuals'. Incentive mechanism design in business processes cannot always assume that the process output is entirely under the control of the concerned employees. The managerial problem is to effectively motivate the employee’s effort through an incentive mechanism that recognizes the employee’s effort as well as environmental factors that have a bearing on the process output.</p>

<p>Employees respond to both explicit incentives and implicit relational contracts. Relational contracts are perceived obligations and expectations of the employees and the organization. To a large extent, organizational culture, trust, and relationships are part of the relational contract. The nature of the explicit incentives and relational contracts can lead to complex interactions among the other three aspects of the business process.</p>

<p>Most importantly, coordinating the interrelationships between the four aspects of the operational core of the business process is the challenge that organizations face in designing optimal business processes. A sample set of such challenges due to pair-wise interactions between the coordination aspects are provided in Table 2.</p>

<p>Most of today’s organizations have grouped by product, geography, and functions that have evolved over time. Naturally, the process steps, business rules, information systems, and motivational structures have also evolved over time; they were not consciously designed based on a set of objectives. Given this, it is extremely challenging to infuse a process-oriented discipline into the organization, and as a result, a large percentage of business process change efforts do fail. Therefore, it is important for managers to understand the difficulties they may face in creating a process-oriented organization.</p>

<p>When large process-change efforts are initiated, the first challenge the organization faces are getting buy-in from the affected functional departments. The main reason behind this is that organizations are traditionally used to defining authority structures, goals, and objectives from a functional perspective. However, when we infuse process-oriented thinking into this type of organization, conflicts and confusion emerge. For example, functionally-oriented departments are often in conflict with the process structure because process goals may not necessarily be aligned with functional department goals (see Figure 3). It is therefore important to consider the alignment of process and functional goals before one considers the creation of a process- oriented organization.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 3, processes cut across traditional functional hierarchies. When we begin to think of process goals first and then evaluate how these process goals translate to functional department goals, the internal stakeholders begin to understand how important the process is to the success of the organization as a whole. Process goals, derived from customer and other stakeholder requirements, can then be decomposed into individual department level goals. For example, in Table 3, we define four different goals for a Loan Application Evaluation Process: (1) cycle time for application evaluation, (2) cost of processing a loan request, (3) level of bad debt due to the loans issued, and (4) errors in processing the request. If we assume that there are three different departments involved in the process, we establish the goals for each of the departments for the Loan Application Evaluation Process. If these departments also serve other processes in the organization, those process goals are defined separately and included when establishing the department level goals.</p>

<h2 id="howlackofmotivationderailsagoodprocessdesign">How Lack of Motivation Derails a Good Process Design</h2>

<p>One of the classic cases of failed process change highlights the importance of designing processes that consider multiple aspects of coordination. In this case, a computer company was in the business of selling custom-configured computing systems. At the time the order was placed, prices were quoted based on the customized configuration requested by the customer. </p>

<p>However, many of the configurations would result in incompatibilities between the parts. If hardware components had to be substituted to correct the configuration, the prices quoted to the customers could not be changed. Therefore, configuration errors eroded company profits and also caused delays in delivery, leading to customer dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>The engineers of the company attempted to reengineer the process by building an expert system that would guide the salespeople in configuring error-free systems at the time of order placement. The system was tested to ensure that it produced error-free orders.</p>

<p>However, several years after deployment, about only 10% of the salespeople continued to use the expert system. The development team addressed many usability issues related to the system, hoping that the improved user interfaces would increase usage. However, despite great improvements in the system, salespeople continued to ignore the system.</p>

<p>On examining the issues more closely, two root causes became evident:</p>

<ul>
<li>The salespeople believed the system inadequately supported the process they were engaged in – which was to sell a computer. In this context, they considered configuration as only a small part of the entire workflow. The salespeople had to assess how much a customer was willing to pay and then interactively create configurations to match it. However, the configuration system did not have any support for the pricing part of the process. It was time-consuming to repeatedly configure error-free systems and then price them separately to get customer approval.</li>
<li>The sales department’s incentives were not dependent on error-free configurations. All costs of configuration changes were charged to the manufacturing division. The sales people were only measured on sales revenues. This motivation structure created a disincentive for the salespeople to spend the extra time on the system to create error-free configurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hammer and Stanton (1999) proposed several measures that we can undertake to help create better alignment between process and functional goals. These measures are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish a process owner: A process owner is generally a high-level manager who collaborates with the functional unit managers to design and monitor the business process. A process owner is not a project manager. A process owner would train the individuals involved in the process and ensure that everyone is working towards achieving the process goals.</li>
<li>Establish a culture of collaboration: Process owners have to work with the functional department heads to ensure that process goals are met. Functional unit heads would be concerned with, among other things, resource allocations, reasonableness of goal, and employee hiring and training. In this type of environment, collaboration between process owners and functional unit heads is extremely important. One approach to enhancing collaboration is through clear articulation of the decision rights.</li>
<li>Align department budgets to process goals: Process goals should be used to establish the rational needs for resources, employees, and timelines. When process goals are translated to department level goals, the budgets for each department can also be rationalized through the different process-related budgets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="managingtheinevitablepitfallsinprocesschange">Managing the Inevitable Pitfalls in Process Change</h2>

<p>The operational core of business processes depicted in Figure 2 recognizes the salient role that Information Systems play in business process design. However, it is important to note that a large percentage of IT-enabled business process change efforts fail to meet the stated business goals. Using the knowledge gleaned from many case studies of IT-enabled business process change efforts, McAfee (2003) identified several factors that contribute to process change pitfalls. These pitfalls are “readily recognizable, consistent across implementations and unambiguously counter productive.”7 Five most commonly occurring pitfalls are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resistance – Disagreements over the process change decisions and/or process design that cause the process change effort to stall.</li>
<li>Inertia – Lack of progress on the process change effort despite (supposed) agreement on process design details.</li>
<li>Misspecification – Making incorrect process design decisions, creating a process or technology that “works” but is a misfit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a new process design is rolled out, there is a danger that we will encounter two additional pitfalls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Misuse – Improper employment of a new technology/process; in a sense, sabotaging the process design through creation of informal and undocumented processes and workarounds.</li>
<li>Nonuse – Lack of adoption of the process or technology; this behavior especially manifests when employees perceive the process or technology as discretionary.
Factors that contribute to these pitfalls can include:  </li>
<li>Process Factors: The number of processes impacted by the process change effort creates volume and scope related difficulties. The larger the number of processes being impacted, the more difficult it is to grapple with all the issues that can be encountered during process change. Additionally, process complexity arising from regulatory requirements, highly stringent requirements for the tasks such as in medicine, space instrumentation, and sophisticated supply chain practices cause pitfalls to emerge during process change. Process factors are the leading causes for the resistance and inertia pitfalls.</li>
<li>Organizational Factors: The number of organizational units (internal or external) affected by the process change impact potential success of the process change effort. While increasing the span of process change may enhance the potential business value, it also increases the risks of failure. When the process being changed is integral to the primary mission and objectives of the organizational units, resistance and inertia to the change is likely to manifest very early on during the effort. When resistance and inertia are effectively tackled, organizational factors can still cause misuse and nonuse pitfalls to emerge.</li>
<li>Technology Factors: Process change efforts may either choose to build customized technology solutions or buy off-the-shelf technologies to enable the process. However, both options have associated risks. Whether a technology is custom-built or bought off-the-shelf and configured, misspecification risks are inherent – especially when process complexity is high. Technology factors are often the predominant cause for the manifestation of misuse and nonuse pitfalls.
Several strategies can be pursued to effectively tackle the potential pitfalls. To mitigate resistance and inertia risks, the interface between the various organization units should be managed at the highest levels. The aim should be to build consensus among various stakeholders on the specific direction of the process change efforts and major decisions related to technology choices. If possible, phased implementation of the proposed process changes should be seriously considered. The incremental approach to implementation facilitates the collection of appropriate metrics to demonstrate the ongoing business value of the changes. Additionally, it enables a spirit of learning among the stakeholders as they get familiar with the impact of the changes on their daily work routines.</li>
</ul>

<p>To mitigate misuse and nonuse threats, training, educational materials, and workshops should be rolled out in a timely fashion. Pre-cutover training prepares stakeholders for the imminent change. Post-cutover training alleviates the inevitable changeover difficulties by tackling the operational issues as they emerge.</p>

<p>In essence, any technology-enabled process change is likely to encounter roadblocks. The process owner and the process change team can manage these pitfalls effectively if they correctly evaluate the organizational issues from the beginning of the process change initiative. The strategies employed by the team should be to mitigate the potentials pitfalls emerging from the process, technology, and organizational factors.</p>

<h2 id="greyhoundreengineersitselfoutofbusiness">Greyhound Reengineers Itself Out of Business</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, the reengineering buzzword had caught on and many companies took on reengineering projects that did not fit well with their business model. As a result, they managed the rollout of the IT-enabled process changes to the extent that the entire business was in jeopardy at the end. Greyhound Corporation was one such company that entered into bankruptcy due, in large part, to the misspecification of the technology and process designs.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the demand pattern for its bus lines, Greyhound began an overhaul of the reservations process. A big part of the reengineering plan was to create a new reservation system called “Trips.” Trips was a centralized reservation system that would allow travelers to make bus reservations over the phone (and Internet). The advance information would allow Greyhound to plan its resource allocations (drivers, buses, etc.) more efficiently. However, when the new process was rolled out, it was a complete disaster.</p>

<p>When rolled out to the entire nation, despite opposition from many managers, the Trips system could not handle the load. While airline reservation systems handled 1-3 stops, bus lines frequently had to contend with 5-10 stops for each reservation. With mainly part-time employees, the reservation system needed to be simple. However, it required more than 40 hours to train employees to use the system. Despite warnings from front-line and IT workers, the system was pushed into the market place, ostensibly to please financial analysts. Very soon the system had to be shelved. Within the next few months, Greyhound entered into bankruptcy proceedings. <br>
In the end, the process design attempted at Greyhound seemed to be unnecessary for a bus service. While it can be argued that a reservation system in markets connecting big metropolitan areas may have been a great value-add for some customer segments, it certainly was unwarranted for the entire Greyhound fleet. The customer base for Greyhound did not have sufficient computer access and probably didn’t plan its travels very much in advance to take advantage of the reservation system. This lack of focus on the needs of the business process seemed to have unnecessarily widened the scope of the system.</p>

<p>The top management seemed to have focused solely on one stakeholder group – the financial analysts. The cut-over plans were also ill-planned. Adequate training and preparation – the cornerstones of a good implementation plan – did not seem to have been considered or supported by the Greyhound senior management team. Additionally, cut-over to a new system during the busiest time of the year for travel compounded the problems.</p>

<p>A current version of Trips today allows ticket purchase online; however, no seat reservations can be made at the time of reservation.</p>

<h2 id="amethodologyforbusinessprocesschange">A Methodology for Business Process Change</h2>

<p>Given the complexities of process change, the entire process change initiative should be guided by a well-designed methodology. In this section, a suggested approach is outlined that can also be adapted to specific process change contexts. As such, the process change effort can be divided into five phases – Initiation, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Management. Each phase is intended to answer a number of basic questions that pertain to the process change effort.</p>

<p>The Initiation phase lays the groundwork for the process change effort. Many process change efforts begin opportunistically (e.g., a major client defects to a competitor, a competitor introduced a new product or service, a major equipment failure occurred at a factory, etc.). For instance, many airlines made massive changes to their business processes in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>It is also possible that the top management team calls for a major process change effort after a prolonged period of complaints from customers and stakeholders. For example, many customer relationship management-related process change efforts begin as a response to low customer retention rates and/or low customer satisfaction survey results. While it may be clear to the management team that a change is needed, it will not be certain as to where the changes should happen and which processes may be impacted. The initiation phase should answer the basic questions related to where changes may be necessary and what should be the goals for the reengineering effort. This is also the phase where core business processes and their metrics are identified. At the end of this phase, a preliminary set of candidate processes are identified for reengineering. The main checkpoints for the initiation phase and any documentation/work products resulting from the related activities are outlined in Table 4.</p>

<p>The Analysis phase documents the as-is or current process in greater detail. In this phase, all stakeholders are identified for the candidate processes; these include customers, managers, employees, and external entities. Additionally, for each process, the trigger events are gathered. These are the event(s) that trigger(s) the business process, milestones – the intermediate and significant events within the process – and endpoints, the event that signals the end of processing for the trigger event(s). <br>
The analysis phase helps to estimate the potential costs and benefits to customers and stakeholders in the as-is business process. When transforming a transactional process (refer to Table 1), the elicitation of trigger events and milestones helps to create high-level process flow diagrams. Main checkpoints for the analysis phase and any documentation/work products resulting from the related activities are outlined in Table 4.</p>

<p>The Design phase involves an analysis of the activities and steps in the process. Benchmarking the process against competing firms within the same industry and benchmarking against best performing firms even outside the industry can help identify possible redesign ideas. For example, Toyota’s production processes are known for efficiency and quality. Its processes have been adapted in both manufacturing and service environments; both corporate and government sectors have also attempted to mimic its approach. Brainstorming redesign ideas with the stakeholders is another useful method; in addition, conducting focus groups with customers can help bring in their perspectives to the design phase as well.</p>

<p>Any new Information System that enables the to-be process should be prototyped in this phase. The prototype system should be shown to the stakeholders to get feedback on usability and suitability to the redesigned work processes. The prototype also helps stakeholders visualize the process changes being considered. As feedback received in this phase is implemented in the Information System and process design, it should be communicated to the stakeholders.</p>

<p>In the redesign of transactional processes, creating as-is and to-be models and simulating the redesign ideas can help evaluate their impact. In the design of collaborative processes, changes to the organization culture and team behavior would be required; social network analysis techniques can be beneficial in this context (we discuss the social network approach in the next module). Iterative processes may require redesign and relocation of several different departments to facilitate better information flows.</p>

<p>The Implementation phase begins with pre-cutover preparations that test out the redesigned processes in selected locations/products/units. The pilot sites help refine the to-be process and facilitate the development of training and education materials for full roll-out. The pilot sites also help recruit early champions of the redesign ideas. These early champions can be great resources to market the process change ideas to the larger organization.</p>

<p>The Management phase continuously monitors the implemented process by tracking performance metrics. Recall the Capabilities Maturity Model (CMM) (see table below). A process at the highest maturity level is continuously monitored and improved to keep the process performance at an optimized level. In this context, the process owner’s role is pivotal. As described earlier in the module, the process owner takes on the training and mentoring role to keep the process performing at a high level.</p>

<h2 id="businessprocessmodeling">Business Process Modeling</h2>

<p>Most organizational processes are hidden; therefore, a systematic approach is required to discover and model these processes. In this module, the focus will be on discovering and modeling workflow-oriented processes. Documenting business processes is a great way to give managers and employees an end-to-end view of the business processes they are engaged in. When employees understand the process completely, they are better able to relate what they do to the overall objectives of the process they are engaged in. <br>
Process Documentation Approaches</p>

<p>One can document business processes by using text based narratives, drawing tools, or sophisticated modeling tools. While text-based narrative is the easiest way to capture process information, it has a few drawbacks. Complex business rules and flows can be hard to explain in words. While individual tasks may be easily explained in a document, the overall process map may be hard to visualize if everything is written in a text-based format. <br>
Drawing tools such as Microsoft Visio can also be used to document business processes. The process models in these documents would help stakeholders understand how the end-to- end process works. However, these drawings tend to be static – multiple views of the process (e.g., processes by role, resources, or departments) would require creation of new documents. It is also hard to check for consistency of the process flow. Advanced analysis of the process flow (for cycle time, resource usage, costs, etc.) is not possible in such drawings.</p>

<p>User-friendly and advanced-process modeling tools are becoming commonplace in the business process management marketplace. A recent Gartner report identified “pre-built frameworks, models, flows, rules and services” and “business process/policy modeling and simulation environment” as one of the key required functionalities in Business Process Management software tools8. Vendors with process modeling tools include IBM (<a href="http://www-">http://www-</a> 306.ibm.com/software/integration/wbimodeler/), CACI (<a href="http://www.simprocess.com">http://www.simprocess.com</a>), iGrafx (<a href="http://www.igrafx.com">http://www.igrafx.com</a>), and IDS Scheer (<a href="http://www.softwareag.com">http://www.softwareag.com</a>). These tools allow analysts to model business processes in a hierarchical fashion (such that different levels of details can be shown to different stakeholders). Additional process parameters such as resource requirements, time durations, locations, and departments can also be associated with the process model.</p>

<h3 id="processmodelsandservicesorientedarchitecturessoa">Process Models and Services Oriented Architectures (SOA)</h3>

<p>Until recently, modeling business processes used to be isolated attempts within the organization to understand and communicate process information. However, soon after the process models were built and communicated they would be forgotten. For example, it was rare to see software development teams use the process model; thus, the information system and process models seldom had anything in common. If eventually the process design was changed, it was unlikely that the documented process models would be changed. Therefore, the process models would quickly become outdated and unused.</p>

<p>However, recent technology advances have made process modeling an integral part of Information Systems and process management. In addition, emerging technology concepts emphasize re-use of information system components by taking advantage of Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). Therefore, building services based on defined business process models increases the ability to reuse components.</p>

<p>In most Business Process Management software tools, individual tasks can be first modeled as a workflow model. In turn, each step in the process can directly map to one or more of the services built using the SOA methodology. A business process can then be an assembly or composition of the set of services. This approach has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Process models directly map to Information Systems components.</li>
<li>Changing a business process would mean a change in the way the different software services are assembled. Thus, process models and information systems can be kept in sync.</li>
<li>Real-time metrics (e.g., number of loan applications processed, cycle time, loan amounts disbursed, risk profiles of the loans, etc.) can be defined and monitored within the modeling environment.</li>
<li>To the extent that a process model is commonly used across various organizational units, the entire set of software services or a subset of the services can be reused in other processes.
The business value of modeling processes, especially in transactional processes, is increasing as the Enterprise systems are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. Process models no longer need to be “shelf-ware,” they are becoming central to the way we analyze, monitor, and manage business processes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modelingbusinessprocesses">Modeling Business Processes</h2>

<p>In this section we will discuss how transactional business processes can be modeled. First we will cover the fundamental patterns in creating the workflow. Then we will discuss how one can elicit the process flow details from the employees who participate in process execution.</p>

<p>From our definition of business processes at the beginning of the module, we know that business processes have events, interrelated tasks, and outcomes. Process models also have to show these events, how the tasks are interrelated, and how the end result is achieved from the sequence of activities. We know that events trigger process execution. However, the interrelationship between tasks occurs in one of several fundamental patterns, which we will now describe. If you have done flowcharting before, you will find that process models are very similar although a process model contains a lot more information. There are six fundamental flow patterns of interrelated tasks in a process model. A brief description of each pattern follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sequence Pattern: This pattern models a series of tasks that are connected to another sequentially. A task begins only after the completion of the previous one.</li>
<li>Parallel Split or AND-Split: This pattern models two paths of tasks which can be performed in parallel (i.e., simultaneously). In the figure below, both Tasks B and C can begin execution simultaneously after Task A completes execution.</li>
<li>Exclusive Choice or OR-Split: This pattern models a decision task in the process. When the decision task is completed, only one of the alternate paths can be performed. In the figure below, either Task B or Task C can be executed after Task A is completed, but not both.</li>
<li>Synchronization or AND-Join: This pattern models the joining of two parallel paths. All the tasks within the two paths must be completed before the next step of tasks can be completed. This pattern is associated with the Parallel Split Pattern. In the figure below, Tasks B and C begin execution simultaneously (Parallel Split). For Task D to begin, both Tasks B and C must be completed.</li>
<li>Simple Merge or OR-Join: This pattern allows a set of alternate paths to flow through to a single path. This pattern is associated with the Exclusive Choice Pattern. Following completion of Task A, either Task B or Task C executes. Task D can begin execution once Task B or C is completed.</li>
<li>Iteration: This pattern models loop backs within the process. In general, decision points initiate loop backs in the process (e.g., when an error is detected).
￼</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elicitingprocessinformation">Eliciting Process Information</h3>

<p>Process modeling appears to be a deceptively simple task, but creating readable process models is really an art. Process modelers have to consider the context and various stakeholder interests in order to decide upon the right level of detail to convey the process-related information. Most process models are hierarchical – that is, they represent process information at different levels of detail.</p>

<p>One approach is to consider designing the process models as a storyboard. Storyboards were popularized by Walt Disney in the 1930s to visualize an animation movie before it was made. This technique has been adapted widely in the film industry to help producers, directors, and cinematographers visualize movie scenes and convey ideas to each other. Similarly, when modeling multiple processes, our top level model would show the overall interactions between processes. When expanding a single process, we would connect the major milestones in the process (akin to major scenes in a movie). Details between milestones are then shown in the next level and so on down to the lower levels that start showing the individual activities in the process.</p>

<p>To acquire the information necessary to create these types of process models, milestones are elicited from the process stakeholders through a series of workshops. The collected milestones are then sequenced by the process modelers and confirmed with the workshop participants. The individual activity level details are then gathered by meeting with smaller groups of participants who directly contribute to those processes. Existing information systems in addition to system and process documentations are also reviewed to ensure consistency of the process models.</p>

<p>When process models are expanded to the level where activities are defined, it becomes extremely useful for Information Systems Designers. The systems designers can expand on these diagrams to create “use cases.” A use case is a description of step-by-step interactions of users with the information system. The uses cases can also describe the business rules that govern the execution of the activity.</p>

<h3 id="swimlanemodels">Swimlane Models</h3>

<p>As-Is process models are needed to highlight the Who, What, and When of the process. The What and When are easily captured by the process boxes and connectors. However, the Who part is not explicit in a simple flowchart like process model. The trick to depict the Who part of the process is to use Swimlane models. Swimlane models assign a lane to each actor, resource, or department. Each level of the process model can show swimlanes describing different actors or departments of the process. Swimlanes can represent organizational roles (but are not typically used to represent names of individuals who perform the tasks). An Information System that is an integral part of the process can also be assigned a Swimlane to model workflow tasks performed by the system.</p>

<p>Swimlanes are also useful to show when hand-offs occur between actors, resources, or departments. These hand-offs are the points where coordination problems will likely emerge.</p>

<h2 id="processdesignprinciples">Process Design Principles</h2>

<p>In an earlier section we discussed strategies for managing the process change initiative to avoid the potential pitfalls. In this section we will briefly review some design principles that are intended to assist in applying known solution patterns to specific problem contexts. By their very nature, design principles tend to be generic and can many times be misinterpreted. However, when the design principles are adapted to the specific problem context, they can help generate valuable redesign ideas. We will begin by reviewing the design principles recommended by Hammer and Champy (1993)9. These principles are aimed at increasing the efficiency and quality of the products and services offered. Note that these principles are not necessarily independent of each other; we might need to apply all of the principles at once to achieve the desired process changes.</p>

<p>Combine several tasks into one: Traditionally tasks are broken into several steps and each step is performed by a different worker. This can introduce a high amount of variance in the process output and efficiency. If the tasks are combined into one, it provides a sense of responsibility and ownership for the worker performing the complete set of tasks. This would mean that the worker is cross-trained to do all of the steps which can – in and of itself – bring flexibility to the process. As a result, any time a customer wants to know the status of the application one single person will be able to report on its status. In essence, the worker becomes the case manager for that particular work entity.</p>

<p>Enable workers to make decisions: One of the ways we can combine tasks is by assigning decision-making authority to workers. For example, if we can clearly define the business rules for approving the loans based on credit worthiness, many workers can be trained to apply these decision rules and make the credit decisions. As they become more experienced in dealing with the complete loan application process, they can begin to introduce innovative ideas on how to improve the process as well. Despite this, there would still be a need to have specialists who can deal with the exceptions in the process. However, benefits have been gained when workers are allowed to handle the routine decisions; in this instance, the wait times in service lines were considerably reduced. This principle leads to a view of the organization in which lower levels of the organizational hierarchy make high-volume, routine decisions; the workers at the higher levels progressively make low-volume but more complex decisions.</p>

<p>Arrange the process steps in a natural order: This principle asks designers to question the flow of process steps and precedence relationships. Many constraints in process steps exist because of the lack of technology or because other process steps evolved around previous process steps. For example, paper-based processing imposes a sequential relationship between steps that do not necessarily depend on each other’s output. When an information system can make the forms or information available centrally, the sequential steps can begin simultaneously. <br>
Create multiple versions of processes: Today’s organizations can create a standard process and then create specializations of this process to accommodate the variability in the types of work it processes. For example, many credit card companies identify the type of cardholder (Gold, Platinum, etc.) before routing the call. The initial assessment of work type can be used to allocate a certain type of process worker or to determine the priority of handling. However, when the variability of the work type is very high, it is advisable to create distinct processes that do not overlap in resource usage. For example, in IT management processes, it might be useful to identify workers who primarily deal with network-related issues and workers who deal only with desktop computer-related issues.</p>

<p>Perform the work where it makes sense: One of the most attractive features of electronic commerce has been customer self-service. Most of us today perform the tasks that our travel agent used to do for us in booking airline tickets. Another example is the self-service checkouts that are becoming more commonplace in supermarkets. The same approach can work wonders in organizational processes as well. Many tasks were centralized in traditional organizations to ensure controls on spending. But information systems provide the visibility needed to centrally monitor or control many of the human tasks, therefore centralizing the tasks as well as the decision rights is unnecessary. For example, today most large organizations negotiate prices centrally with suppliers while it is the individual units within the organizations that make the actual purchases. Here, the price negotiation and purchasing tasks are separated and performed where it makes the most sense.</p>

<p>Checks and controls are reduced: Checks and controls in processes are meaningful if they are rare and significant. When checks and controls are routinely applied, they begin to impede on the natural flow of tasks within the process. Information systems, however, can provide the control ability without being intrusive. Constraints on decisions can be placed by incorporating appropriate business rules within the information system. Judicious analysis of the costs of errors should be examined to create appropriate control strategies. Another perspective is to use checks and controls as a means to create a learning environment. The Toyota Production System enables workers to stop the assembly line anytime they notice an error. The intent is to identify the root causes of the error at its source and fix it immediately. Each worker in the assembly line collaborates with the supervisor to analyze the error and institute corrective actions directly.</p>

<p>Reconciliation steps are minimized: When duplicate information is captured at multiple points, the potential for errors are magnified. Unfortunately, such situations are fairly common. Process workers often spend more time on reconciling information from different sources than on doing the actual work. Hammer and Champy use a scenario from Ford Motor Corporation to reinforce this observation. Ford’s accounts payable employees used to spend an inordinate amount of time reconciling the differences between purchase orders, invoices, and delivery notes. When the three pieces of information did not match, they had to follow-up with the supplier and the unit that ordered the parts. When Ford reengineered the accounts payable process, it required only the purchase order for the entire process. The supplier had to supply the exact quantity on the purchase order; if not, the delivery would not be accepted. Everyone in the process could view the purchase order in an online system. The number of reconciliations was reduced to a minimal amount after the process was reengineered.</p>

<p>In addition to these principles, the knowledge of how efficient production systems are configured naturally lead to additional principles of design. Highly-efficient production systems reduce batch sizes to a minimum that shrinks work-in-process inventory to near zero and allow upstream tasks to be “pulled” by downstream customers. This is also the basic principle behind “just-in-time” production; also meant to keep work-in-process inventory to the minimum. When the level of activity fluctuates in a process, capacity has to be increased to allow for peak time performance. To control process activities, managers should attempt to reduce the fluctuations in the workflow or create variable capacity levels to address the peak time performance levels. In addition, employees should be given simple visual cues to quickly identify deviations from performance standards.</p>

<p>The cases used as reading assignments in this module give you more opportunities to consider the usefulness of these redesign principles. In the next module, you will also begin to study how collaborative processes can be reengineered to accommodate mass participation from your suppliers and customers. Even in these collaborative processes, information systems play a crucial enabling role.</p>

<h3 id="varianceimpactonprocessperformance">Variance Impact on Process Performance</h3>

<p>The common theme throughout the above principles is an attempt to reduce the variability in process – whether it is in the inputs or tasks or outputs. See Figure 5 for a summary of the sources of variance and instruments for variance reduction in processes.</p>

<p>In the figure, the business environment includes competition and economy but would also encompass other things such as government policies, regulations, changes in consumer preferences, etc. Variance in input can occur due to changes in these business environment related factors. Many of these are mostly out of management’s control; managers can merely react to the changes (or try to predict some of the effects). Corrective actions to react to changes include pricing, promotions, creation of reward &amp; penalty structures, introduction of new products, and so on.</p>

<p>Organizations themselves also cause variance in inputs through their decisions. Advertising and promotions can cause a surge in demand for products or services; penalties imposed on customers in service environments may cause customer attrition or changes in the demand pattern. These input variances put a strain on the management of the tasks within the process. Managers must have adequate resources to handle demand surges; however, sudden drops in demand can also lead to increased costs due to excess capacity. As a result, both business environment and managerial actions impact input variability. The key difference is that managerial actions are intentional (i.e., under management control) whereas business environment impacts are less likely to be controlled by managerial actions.</p>

<p>Another cause of variances is the way a process itself is organized. As an example, unclear business rules or complex process designs can lead to an increased number of errors. These errors, in turn, can increase the variance in the output (through delayed deliveries or defective products or services). Variable traffic patterns to retail stores also cause difficulties in scheduling customer service representative times in the store. Managers can respond to these threats through several initiatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>To minimize variance in task processing times, they can increase the effectiveness of their training programs.</li>
<li>To deal with variable traffic patterns, they can use computerized scheduling systems to effectively plan employee work hours.</li>
<li>To accommodate peak traffic on their web stores, managers can outsource computing resource management to vendors who can provide scalable computing power on demand.</li>
<li>To improve worker productivity, managers can institute incentive and reward programs aimed at improving a culture of performance within the process.
￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it should be recognized that high input variance causes increased pressures on employees and managers in the process. As managers use computerized scheduling systems to address variations in traffic patterns, employees may see high amounts of variability in their schedules. This could cause hardships and/or conflicts for their families when planning around scheduled work hours on a week-to-week basis. <br>
Finally, performance metrics play an important feedback role for the organization. Performance metrics influence how employees respond to work; it can also influence the types of input traffic and demand. The feedback loop in Figure 5 from performance metrics to process and input is intended to show how measurement impacts process and its inputs. For example, if you use the “amount of time spent on a call” as a metric for a call center, it changes behavior of call center agents as they attempt to complete calls in as short a time as possible. Over time, this type of behavior can lead to dissatisfaction and cause customers to call back again and again to resolve problems – they might even stop doing business with the company (i.e., metrics had an undesired impact on process input as well).</p>

<h2 id="simulatingbusinessprocesses">Simulating Business Processes</h2>

<p>Static process models in the form of flowcharts are a good way to create abstract models of business processes. These static models help process stakeholders understand the end-to-end process visually. However, static models are not of much benefit in analyzing the impact of resource allocation decisions, bottlenecks, and random events. In such cases, simulation modeling tools can be used to analyze a number of different scenarios on both as-is and to-be process models. <br>
A number of common process-related dynamics are apparent from </p>

<p>Figure 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>The business environment may quickly change resulting in reduced customer order flow or materials supplies.</li>
<li>An advertising blitz promoting a new product may double or triple customer traffic to the e-commerce site, overwhelming servers and databases.</li>
<li>A new cross-training initiative may be considered as an alternative for an existing process that is dependent on specialized worker pools. The benefits of the cross- training initiative are being debated, but quantifying the benefits has been difficult.</li>
<li>The impact of worker absences on process performance has been hard to quantify.</li>
<li>The use of activity-based costing (ABC) is being promoted, but discovering the cost
drivers within the business process has been contentious. <br>
Simulation modeling tools can greatly help managers in assessing these dynamics. The benefit of simulating an as-is process with historical data is that it validates the accuracy of the process model to the stakeholders. The evaluation of various alternatives against the baseline (the as-is model) is then easier to justify.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to remember that models are abstractions of reality. We want to model only those attributes of the process that are important. Attempting to model every single step, information, resource, and cost would only serve to lengthen the process redesign effort without any corresponding increase in benefit.</p>

<h2 id="modulesummary">Module Summary</h2>

<p>Many business process design initiatives fall into the trap of either focusing entirely on technology to automate existing workflows or focusing on business rules and cultural issues without considering the enabling role of technology. Either approach fails to fully capture all the aspects of coordination mechanisms in a business process. In order to define new processes and even new businesses shaped by technology, one has to understand the workflow, information system, business rules, and motivation structures. That said business process change is a difficult proposition. It can simultaneously affect multiple organizational units; thereby, raising political flags of resistance and inertia across the organization. The synonymous link between process reengineering and layoffs does not help the situation either.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, reengineering concepts and methods have achieved a high level of maturity. The initial reckless approach of ignoring the detrimental impact on stakeholders (especially the employee) has been replaced by a more pragmatic approach to process reengineering. Reengineering does not always need to be a radical reorganization of the process to achieve the desired effect. As outlined in this module, a rational approach to process reengineering can yield pragmatic process redesign ideas that potentially accommodate a majority of stakeholder interests.</p>

<p>The design principles outlined in this module are applicable in most workflow design contexts. However, many business processes are not workflow driven. It is hard to identify task interrelationships in processes driven by information exchange and interpersonal communications. Many high impact business processes such as new product development, the budgeting process, designing advertising campaigns, and creating marketing strategies are highly collaborative in nature. Such processes require a very different approach to analysis and redesign. We will cover these types of processes in a subsequent course module.</p>

  <p>The case 'Google Inc.' describes Google's history, business model, governance structure, corporate culture, and processes for managing innovation. It reviews Google's recent strategic initiatives and the threats they pose to Yahoo!, Microsoft, and others. It also asks what Google should do next. One option is to stay focused on the company's core competence, i.e., developing superior search solutions and monetizing them through targeted advertising. Another option is to branch into new arenas; for example, build Google into a portal like Yahoo! or MSN; extend Google's role in e-commerce beyond search, to encompass a more active role as an intermediary (like eBay) facilitating transactions; or challenge Microsoft's position on the PC desktop by developing software to compete with Office and Windows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/product/google-inc/910036-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a></p>

<p>What were the key factors behind Google's early success? Google currently enjoys approximately 70% market share of US searches, and well above 90% in many other countries. Do you expect the search business to become more concentrated (i.e., dominated by fewer firms)? Is search a winner-take-all business?</p>

<p>The key factors of Google’s early success were its superior search engine, synergistic revenue generation, and its innovative corporate culture. The foremost factor is Google’s search engine. Early internet search engines were typically curated by hand, but as the number of webpages grew and existing pages were continually updated, this became impractical. Later, search results were automated using keywords, but this led to a lot of spam and useless results. Google’s innovative PageRank algorithm favored pages that were referenced/linked to by other pages; this method produced better search results and user experience than competitors could offer. </p>

<p>Google continued to improve on their competitive advantage of superior search technology through “sponsored links.”  At the time, the competition used the highest bid to determine ad placement, but Google took relevance and click through rate into consideration. By integrating this with Overture’s practice of bidding for pay per click with their own strategy of pay per view, they created an incentive for advertisers to provide more useful results for users. This worked synergistically to increase customer experience while also increasing Google’s profitability.</p>

<p>Google used its thriving revenue generation to hire some of the best talent in the industry.  Further, employees were permitted to work on projects outside the core business for 20% of the workday, which eventually led to products like Gmail and Google News. By not being evil, they engender trust amongst their users. This trust allowed them access to more user data, which in turn allowed them to create better products and services leading to superior customer loyalty.</p>

<p>Over time, the search business has become more concentrated and will continue to do so. It is currently either a monopolistic or duopolistic system. In the latter case, there’s usually only Google and a local market player. It’s unlikely that these local players will completely disappear, and Google is unlikely to acquire these competitors for fear of antitrust litigation.  Over time, these minority players will become more marginalized, leading to a winner-take-nearly-all system. Bing is the second-largest search provider, at 19% market share.  This is likely because Microsoft browsers use Bing as their default search tool. Even still, there is only one player in the market whose name has become synonymous with the function it provides.  “Google” is the only verb in the search industry and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Should Google pursue portal, software, and/or e-commerce opportunities? In other words, in addition to enhancing its core search businesses, should Google also branch out into new arenas of (a) building a full-fledged portal like Yahoo!'s, (b) targeting Microsoft's desktop software hegemony, and/or (c) becoming an e-commerce intermediary like eBay?</p>

<p>Should Google build a portal like Yahoo!? <br>
No.  Google’s top executives have indicated they believe this is a “tired model.” After emphasizing a business strategy based upon “playing their strengths,” the idea of watering down the service they provide with additional content seems to be counterintuitive.  Also, if Google were to shift focus from being a “search function” to being more of a “search suite” they would likely also require a restructure of their “work priorities” to support a new, more developmental business strategy.  Google previously pursued a portal service called iGoogle, but discontinued support in 2013.  According to Google’s support site, the service was discontinued because Google believed portal services were less useful given the advent of applications and widgets available on smartphones.</p>

<p>Should Google develop desktop software? <br>
Yes.  Entry into desktop software would be a worthwhile venture for Google, especially given their current presence in the operating system market with ChromeOS.  All software could be aligned with existing Google products such as ChromeOS, the Chrome browser, and Gmail, creating a seamless user experience on computers and mobile devices alike. The software suite could be supported on the cloud and loaded on mobile phones and tablets through the already existent Google Drive.  The main advantage to having a software suite in addition to the Google Drive offerings is allowing users to have a fully functional offline capability that augments and integrates with Google’s existing products. </p>

<p>Should Google become an e-commerce intermediary like eBay? <br>
No. In order to enter the arena with competition such as Amazon and eBay, an enormous amount of capital would be required, and success would not be guaranteed.  With the modularity that Google has developed, and the ability to “add-on” to other applications, such as utilizing Google Drive for storage, or Google Wallet for payments, they should stick to doing what they are good at.  This strategy falls in line with Google’s emphasis on playing to their strengths.  Rather than starting an e-commerce intermediary from scratch, a more logical move would be to hone their Google Wallet application and bond it to an already existing e-commerce solution, just as PayPal did with eBay. This would require much less capital and likely fit well into Google’s already existing prioritization structure. Further evidence against an e-commerce solution is Google’s dominance in the search engine market.  There is a potential conflict of interest that arises in the instance of an online shopper searching Google for a product to purchase, only to find the Google e-commerce solution is the first result.This could dissuade online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay from future dealings with Google’s suite of products, such as accepting Google Wallet for payment or paying for prime advertising on sites like YouTube.</p>

  <p>This case explores the topic of offshoring high-tech jobs several perspectives. The issues presented include determining the stock price consequences of offshoring, examining the economic consequences of the offshore job to both the transferring and receiving countries, considering the competitive consequences of not offshoring, and thinking through the challenge of investing in a career that is vulnerable to future offshoring.</p>

<p>Use the sourcing decision cycle framework in Chapter 9 and analyze the situation where Global Information Systems, Inc. was in 2004. What kind of outsourcing decision did it try to make?</p>

<p>In 2004, GIS had reached a point in the sourcing decision cycle framework where they needed to decide to keep the status quo or change its sourcing model.  GIS had previously established their own in-house programming centers in India, China, and Brazil.  These are examples of captive centers.  Going forward, however, GIS was looking not just to grow into these captive centers, but rather to actively move existing U.S. jobs offshore. </p>

<p>In deciding whether to “make or buy,” GIS weighed whether it should shift some of its IT capability from make to buy, specifically 3,000 programming jobs. These jobs, formerly domestically insourced positions, would be outsourced to existing GIS locations in China, India and Brazil. The reason for supporting this approach was that huge capacity expansion plus large price reductions made it more efficient to establish customer service/call centers, software development centers, engineering design centers, and back office accounting centers in low-cost areas of the world that were developing politically and socially reliable infrastructures.</p>

<p>Due to the political landscape with respect to outsourcing, GIS faced a tough decision to outsource domestically or internationally.  The company eventually chose an international outsourcing model which projected to save them $261 million per year in human capital expenditure. For example, “a U.S. programmer with a total employment cost (salary and all benefits) of $112,000 per year would be replaced by an offshore programmer with a total employment cost of $25,000 per year.” Although roughly 35% of those savings would be consumed by telecommunication and management costs, after an initial loss of $19 million the first year and a savings of only $40 million the second year, GIS would net $168 million per year in savings by outsourcing these positions, from the third year onward. </p>

<p>The decision GIS was trying to make, which was eventually supporting by Harding, was a shift from insourcing to offshoring.  More specifically, GIS was considering selective farshoring, since they were moving specific IT capabilities (programming) but not all job functions to distant lands, with the goal of substantial cost savings. </p>

What are the key assumptions that could make offshoring a "win-win" situation for both developed and developing economies? How should Jane Harding advise her son Jason?</p>

<p>Key assumptions that could make offshoring a “win-win” situation for both developed and developing economies are that the offshoring countries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a cost savings through reduced labor costs </li>
<li>Provide highly educated and competent labor force</li>
<li>Provide continuing education to ensure support for technical upgrades</li>
<li>Ensure there are no language barriers</li>
<li>Ensure there is political stability</li>
<li>Have lower crime rates</li>
<li>Have friendly relations with the client company</li>
<li>Ensure security and/or trade restrictions</li>
<li>Keep company secrets and proprietary information private</li>
<li>Ensure availability of scalable technical infrastructure</li>
<li>Ensure cultural differences are known and negotiated prior to starting partnership</li>
<li>Account for time differences to ensure proper communication of deadlines</li>
</ul>

<p>Jane Harding’s son, Jason, requested advice on whether,  “he should pursue a degree in humanities or whether he should have a more ‘preprofessional’ focus to his studies such as on engineering, computer science or premed.”  When determining a career path, there are several areas to consider including career happiness (passion for the job), earning potential and stability of the chosen career path.</p>

<p>In considering the humanities,  there is no shortage of teachers in the workforce today and appears to be a sustainable long term career choice.  On the other hand, the mean annual salary is just under $80k, whereas premed for instance, has a mean salary in excess of $100k.</p>

<p>There are many factors that Jason must consider before making a decision, but it is also important that he becomes educated on the topic of outsourcing before deciding which area of study he will pursue. As technology evolves, locational dependencies become a much smaller factor when choosing a career path. Long-distance learning, and thus teaching, is becoming just as prevalent today as outsourced computer programming. The key for Jason’s success will be, not only the career path that he chooses, but the environment and and situation in which he does it. Although much of the traditional “Engineering” type work is being outsourced, there will always be parts of it that, for one reason or another, cannot be. For example, a network engineer that works for a public school may be replaceable through outsourcing, but the same job working for say a Department Of Defense school, for security reasons, may not be. When it comes down to the choice of which field of study is “safer,” there is not a definitive answer, because there are none. Jason must become educated in the field that he feels is right for him, and know that he will need to create a “niche” for himself in order to create his own job security. With technology breaking the restriction caused by location, this will likely be the case regardless of which field Jason decides to pursue.</p>

  <p>By covering information technology (IT) management at Air Canada over two decades, this case illustrates the process of alignment between IT and business over time. During the 1990s, the focus was on efficiency and the IT department supported business through both the centralization of the IT function and the outsourcing of most of the IT activities, with the explicit objective of reducing costs. Twenty years later, at the time the case takes place, Air Canada had two key strategic objectives: operational excellence and customer proximity. In order to help meet these two objectives, IT now supported business through a hybrid structure and an innovation-based, "best-of-breed" sourcing strategy. Also, over the years, the IT department at Air Canada had developed processes aimed at ensuring efficient delivery of services by suppliers, as well as in-house processes to scan, identify and implement innovative IT solutions both for operational excellence and customer proximity.</p>

<p>Managing the information resource of a firm focused on both “engaging with customers” and competing “more effectively on multiple levels against the low-pricing structures offered by low-cost carriers” entailed many challenges, which Air Canada’s CIO and her team had been addressing in multiple ways. How was Air Canada addressing these challenges in 2011? </p>

<p>In 2010, Air Canada was already a thriving empire in the airline industry. They had gone through an extreme period of growth and partnered with many world renowned airlines and formed the Star Alliance. As 2011 approached,  Air Canada’s business strategy shifted from expansion to sustainment. In response to this strategy shift, two main business goals were developed: cost reduction and improved customer engagement. In order to reach their new business goals, they focused on three main areas that included “operational process improvements, supplier contract renegotiations and revenue productivity gains.”  </p>

<p>In 2011, efforts were focused on improving efficiency in these three areas;  therefore, they  implemented a “multi-vendor strategy in order to benefit from specialized, best-of-breed airline products available in the market more quickly and less expensively.”  A better sourcing strategy was needed which led to IBM being assigned to act as the “integrator” and  as the “keeper and guardian of Air Canada’s corporate standards.”  During this time, Air Canada also  moved to a relational approach “to manage its outsourcing contracts with multiple vendors.” To the CIO, “having a successful IT outsourcing contract meant being accountable for the problems that arise and taking a collaborative approach with vendors to problem solve.”</p>

<p>Aligned closely to a matrix organizational structure, the IT department had been reorganized to a new structure  and “an IT representative was assigned to each of the three main branches:  Customers, Commercials and Operation.” This new structure ensured that there was “one common goal: to link the business side and IT,” and that “new solutions had to add value to the business, be in line with corporate standards, and potentially contribute to the overall cost savings.”  Through this new reorganization and  implementation of IT, not only was cost reduction achieved, but customer engagement was also improved. By linking all IT within the organization, information was able to be shared throughout every department and improved the customer experience. Additionally, the Electronic Customer Relationship Management (e-CRM) team was developed, and through the sharing of  information this team was able to gather intimate knowledge on its’ customers and provide for their individual requirements.</p>

<p>In aligning its business and IT strategies, how did Air Canada cope with <a href="http://pompeiiconsulting.com/strategic-alignment" target="_blank">the five competitive forces</a>? In order to further improve its business-IT alignment, what areas should Air Canada target next and what actions should it take?</p>

<p>Air Canada recognized that in order to compete with low-cost carriers, it would require reducing costs.  Air Canada’s number one cost was fuel, which they had no control over; therefore, they instituted a Cost Transformation Program (CTP) focusing on “operational process improvements, supplier contract renegotiations, and revenue productivity gains.”  Air Canada’s strategy for coping with the five competitive forces included: <br>
Potential threat of new entrants -  Improved operational processes by entering major partnerships with Lufthansa and United/Continental.  These partnerships created barriers to entry for new airlines, who would struggle to compete with Air Canada’s global reach. Air Canada accomplished this through large investments in IT,  which allowed them to  maintain high quality and competitive  services with low cost carriers.   </p>

<p>Bargaining power of buyers - Allowed competition with the low-cost carriers as part of the CTP..  Lowered costs were achieved by using IT to optimize processes like the ones used by the pilots and crews for choosing flights.  The addition of customer facing systems, such as allowing customers to upgrade online or on mobile devices, increased buyer’s bargaining power in a mutually beneficial way. </p>

<p>Bargaining power of suppliers - In 2011, used multiple vendors to accomplish a bulk of its IT needs, thus lowering the leverage to each supplier.  Air Canada assigned IBM to be the integrator of each vendor’s product, ensuring a seamless fit with current and legacy systems. Additionally, contract negotiations were accomplished through the use of Requests for Proposals which breeds competition. </p>

<p>Threat of substitute products - Made the “cost” of switching airlines higher by being the first to introduce electronic boarding passes and then iPhone and BlackBerry applications.  The convenience Air Canada provided the customer likely factored into the decision-making process of the customers potentially considering switching airlines. </p>

<p>Industry competitors - Acquired their main rival (Canadian Airlines) and created partnerships with major airlines (Lufthansa/United Continental).  Using IT to drive costs down through innovation kept Air Canada a step ahead of its competitors.</p>

<p>Next areas for Air Canada to target should include the performance of research into the IT-business strategy of the major airlines with whom they partner.  Joint IT-business meetings between the partners could result in lessons learned for both sides, potentially lead to better integration of functionality between airlines and improve data sharing.  Investment in data analytics and analysis of customer, operational, and/or shared data for business intelligence should also be explored. .  </p>

<p>Future Air Canada actions should include having  the CIO and business teams from Air Canada, Lufthansa, and United/Continental meet on a regular basis.  The purpose of these meetings should include discussing and planning ways to integrate IT capability which ultimately will result in an increase in value to the customers and to the businesses.  </p>

<ul>
<li>system used to gain competitive advantage in the market place</li>
<li>11% of IT expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="valuingitinvestments">Valuing IT Investments</h2>

<p>IT investments are difficult to assess value for because:</p>

<ul>
<li>IT can be a significant part of the annual budget, thus under close scrutiny</li>
<li>the systems themselves are complex and calculating the costs is an art not a science</li>
<li>many IT investments are for infrastructure; the payback period is much longer than other capital investments</li>
<li>oftentimes the payback cannot be calculated because the investment is a necessity rather than a choice</li>
<li>there is no tangible payback</li>
</ul>

<p>IT investment valuation is necessary</p>

<h3 id="approachestoitvaluation">Approaches to IT Valuation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Return on Investment (ROI)
<ul><li>ROI= (Estimated lifetime benefits - Estimated lifetime costs) / (Estimated lifetime costs)</li></ul></li>
<li>Net Present Value (NPV)
<ul><li>Calculated by discounting the costs and benefits for each year of system’s lifetime using present value (PV)</li>

<li>Simulation
<ul><li>A model is used to test the impact of a new system or series of tasks; low-cost method</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optionspricing">Options Pricing</h2>

<ul>
<li>NPV involves only tow choices
<ul><li>we do</li>
<li>we don't</li></ul></li>
<li>options pricing allows one to take future action in response to uncertainty about changes in the business environment</li>
<li>offers a risk hedge strategy to minimize negative impact of risk by waiting to see what happens</li>
<li>applicable when
<ul><li>an investment can be deferred</li>
<li>a balance between waiting for information and forgoing revenues</li>
<li>emerging investments</li>
<li>prototyping investment</li>
<li>technology as product investments</li></ul></li>
<li>Used along with DCF when the decision to pursue an investment can be deferred for some period of time</li>
<li>many investments particularly strategic ones like IT bear a strong resemblance to a financial call option</li>
<li>a call option is an option but not an obligation to buy an asset with value (S) by paying a pre-set price (X) on or before a certain point in time
<ul><li>European Option: on a specific date</li>
<li>American Option: on or before a specific date</li></ul></li>
<li>NPV only allows managers to make a decision now on an asset and then see what happens</li>
<li>managers can get to wait and see what happens, until some uncertainty is resolved and then make decision to invest or not</li>

<p>Funding Methods</p>

<ul><li>chargeback</li>
<li>allocation</li>
<li>corporate budget</li></ul>

<h3 id="chargeback">Chargeback</h3>

<ul><li>IT costs are recovered by charging individuals, departments, or business units based on actual usage</li>
<li>rates of usage are calculated based on the actual cost to the IT group to run the system and billed out on a regular basis </li>
<li>charge is popular because it is viewed as the most equitable way to recover IT costs</li>
<li>creating and managing chargeback system is a costly endeavor due to the need to collect extensive system usage data</li>
<li>done for management reasons</li></ul>

<h3 id="allocation">Allocation</h3>

<ul><li>recovers costs based on some simplified metrics other than usage such as revenues, log-in accounts, or number of employees</li>
<li>its primary advantage is that it is simpler to implement and apply</li>
<li>free rider problem</li>
<li>deciding the basis for charging out the costs can be a problem</li>
<li>true up process is needed where total IT expenses are compared to total IT funds recovered from the business units</li>
<li>done for management reasons</li></ul>

<h3 id="corporatebudget">Corporate Budget</h3>

<ul><li>here the costs fall to the corporate bottom line rather than levying charges on specific users or business units</li>
<li>no requirement to calculate prices of the IT systems and hence no financial concerns raised monthly by business managers</li>
<li><p>IT has to compete with all other budgeted items for funds</p></li>
<li><p>chargeback, allocation, corporate budget treat IT as a cost center not a profit center</p></li>
<li>most bac=sic method of determining costs is to add up all of the hardware, software, network, and people involved in Information Systems.</li>
<li>real cost is not as easy to determine</li>
<li>most companies continue to use this over-simplistic view of determining cost and never really know the real cost</li></ul>

<h3 id="activitybasedcosting">Activity Based Costing</h3>

<ul><li>activity based costing (ABC) counts the actual activities that go into making a specific product or delivering a specific service</li>
<li>activities are processes, function, or tasks that occur over time and have recognized results</li>
<li>activities consume assigned resources to produce products and services</li>
<li>activates are useful in costing because they are the common denominator between business process improvement and information improvement</li>
<li>ABC charges all costs to profit centers not cost centers</li></ul>

  <p>Focuses on a major transformation of Otis Elevator's infrastructure. Led by the CEO, this transformation represents a remarkable long-term reengineering of all the processes of the firm to drive its operating costs down and service image up. The transformation is the continuation of a process that has been going on for more than 20 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/product/otis-elevator-accelerating-business-transformation-with-it/305048-PDF-ENG" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a></p>

<p>The IT tools being used by Otis in 2004 were simple – database, workflow software, Intranets and Extranets, email – but the benefits appeared to be extraordinary. What are the things that really had changed in the company over the last few years leading up to 2005?</p>

<p>Otis Elevator’s earliest initiatives had been to build the business through massive acquisitions. Through these acquisitions, Otis was able to expand its customer base extensively and became the “largest manufacturer, installer, and servicer of elevators, escalators, and moving walkways in the world.”    While these acquisitions had been extremely profitable, Otis leadership knew that without consolidation and standardization of products and services within the company, that continued profitability would not be sustainable. </p>

<p>In the years leading up to 2005, Otis leadership recognized their business strategy needed to shift to compare to benchmark companies like UPS who had institutionalized customer service, and developed standardized  workflow processes and metrics to govern every customer interaction and internal activity. The vision moving forward was to become the recognized leader in service excellence among all companies – not just elevator companies – worldwide.</p>

<p>In order to align the  new vision with its business strategy, Otis needed to reduce the number of modules in use and lower project costs.  The SIMBA program was introduced to “fundamentally change the architecture and ultimately the design process; the goal was a standard-interface, modular-based architecture defining modules and subsystems from which all Otis elevator systems could be created.”  Also introduced with the SIMBA program was standard terminology. In the past, Otis verbiage varied so much throughout the organization that communications within the company could be misconstrued or misinterpreted. Through the implementation of a standardized terminology, important concepts such as “contracts, proposals, projects and field modules” would have the same meaning to any party requiring information as to the status of one of these steps in the development or implementation phase. </p>

<p>Tony Black of Otis Field Operations shared the “e-Logistics program which is based on the maturity of SIP.  If we hadn’t done SIP, and just did the e-Logistics program, it would have taken much longer.”   In sum,  Otis Elevator was no longer an “old-line can’t miss industrial firm, which only needed caretakers” as was the description provided by Tom Wolfe decades earlier. </p>

<p><br></p>

<hr>

<p><br></p>

<p>With the e-Logistics program, best practice from SIP are baked into the company and institutionalized to achieve that continuous transformation. How do the systems that comprise the e-Logistics program bake in an institutionalized best practice?</p>

<p>Implementation of the  e-Logistics information transformation project provided Otis’ IT systems with the resources needed to “facilitate business process re-engineering that was taking place throughout.” This was  accomplished by taking the lessons learned from the initial Sales and Installation Process (SIP), and integrating them into a company-wide IT solution geared toward its evolving business model. The  e-Logistics program was built over a two year timeframe by gathering information from subject matter experts in the fields of “sales, field, and order management along with IT project managers.” By doing this, Otis was able to demonstrate the ideals of Pearlson and Saunders when they wrote, “In an organization that operates successfully, an overriding business strategy drives both organizational strategy and information strategy.”  </p>

<p>From an organizational perspective, the Project Proposal phase used a mandatory electronic pre-bid checklist which had to be approved by both the sales representative and the field-installation supervisor. Prior to e-Logistics, this was a manual process, and often times the field-installation supervisor did not even see the checklist or know the requirements until it was time for install.  Instituting this pre-bid checklist ensured the sales and field organizations worked together from the beginning of the process, increased process cohesion and allowed for minimal delays at install.  From an IS perspective, former manual systems, such as booking, validation and scheduling, became centrally automated.  This allowed for the e-Logistics software to automatically push data to appropriate supervisory and financial personnel.  Automated information sharing ensures each  party receives information  efficiently and decreases the need for middle  management. </p>

<p>The Order Fulfillment phase is another example of institutionalization, as field-installation supervisors were responsible for relaying when job sites were ready for deliveries.  The automated email service within e-Logistics prompts supervisors to check in on sites,  allows for status updates and face-to-face interactions with contractors.  This demonstrates how e-Logistics institutionalized site preparation, allowing for the implementation of the “pull” system.  Otis’ Tony Black said that the automated email and reminder process, “forces critical steps of SIP and makes good process part of the way you do business.”</p>

<p>By taking best practices from SIP and integrating them into the automated, e-Logistics program, it ensured both present and future Otis employees would execute these best practices.  This institutionalized, “baked in” program prevents best practices from being lost in two ways: 1) Mandatory use for nearly all employees, which helped Otis move away from many inefficient  manual processes and 2) best practices were now being held within the program, preventing an individual leaving the company and taking job-specific or institutional knowledge with them.  </p>

  <p>Many of the pioneers of Internet business, both dot-coms and established companies, have competed in ways that violate nearly every precept of good strategy. Rather than focus on profits, they have chased customers indiscriminately through discounting, channel incentives, and advertising. Rather than concentrate on delivering value that earns an attractive price from customers, they have pursued indirect revenues such as advertising and click-through fees. Rather than make trade-offs, they have rushed to offer every conceivable product or service. It did not have to be this way--and it does not have to be in the future. When it comes to reinforcing a distinctive strategy, Michael Porter argues, the Internet provides a better technological platform than previous generations of IT. Gaining competitive advantage does not require a radically new approach to business; it requires building on the proven principles of effective strategy. Porter argues that, contrary to recent thought, the Internet is not disruptive to most existing industries and established companies. It rarely nullifies important sources of competitive advantage in an industry; it often makes them even more valuable. And as all companies embrace Internet technology, the Internet itself will be neutralized as a source of advantage. Robust competitive advantages will arise instead from traditional strengths such as unique products, proprietary content, and distinctive physical activities. Internet technology may be able to fortify those advantages, but it is unlikely to supplant them.</p>

<p>Why isn’t a business strategy sufficient for a company to determine how it can leverage IT for competitive advantage? Based on the descriptions of "Strategy and the Internet", how would you characterize Walgreens’ business strategy and IS strategy in using the Internet for its business?</p>

<p>Business strategy alone is not sufficient for a company to determine how it can leverage IT for competitive advantage. As stated in the IS Strategy Triangle slide, “companies are said to be in alignment when their business strategy is supported/enabled/driven by their information strategy.” The business strategy must be adhered to first and foremost with the organizational and information strategy supporting and aligning with it. In order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, the business needs “to be more profitable than the average performer,” according to the Strategy and the Internet article. The article further indicates that operational effectiveness, and strategic positioning are key drivers for competitive advantage. Business strategy and IT both come with their own strengths.  In Managing and Using Information Systems, the author states that “IS and business maturity must be aligned to provide the right level of information resources to the business.” It is imperative that IT be leveraged as a participant in the overall business strategy, but sustainability and profitability need to be the key drivers. <br>
Walgreens’ business and IS strategy can be characterized as a two-pronged model for success. By integrating the internet (i.e. online ordering services), rather than cannibalizing or forfeiting their established core business strategy (brick and mortar stores), the company was able to increase the success of its existing business model through the use of a complementary arrangement between the two channels. Walgreens embraced the ideals from the article that stated, “Established companies will be most successful when they deploy Internet technology to reconfigure traditional activities or when they find new combinations of Internet and traditional approaches.” This ideal allowed them to reach a larger, more diverse customer base, while continuing to satisfy its existing one. <br>

Use the Porter’s 5 competitive forces model, perform an analysis similar to the one by Porter on pages 5-7 in “Strategy and the Internet,” and predict how the phenomena of Web 2.0 like social networking would influence industry structure and profitability for an average firm?</p>

<h3 id="threatofnewentrants">Threat of New Entrants</h3>

<p>(-) “Sharing economy” has drastically reduced the barriers to entry for service work, both on-site and remote. (-) Lower barrier to entry for products, ideas can be shared and go viral over social media. (-) Crowdfunding, such as Kickstarter reduce capital requirements for entrants into a product category. (+) Synergy between established physical locations and mobile, such as grubhub and postmates, adds value to existing infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="bargainingpowerofbuyers">Bargaining Power of Buyers</h3>

<p>(-) Bargaining power of end user increases due to ease and availability of information about new, alternative, and rival products. (-) Buyers can insinuate a bidding war, by having firms compete on price (-) Buyers have drastically increased power and voice due to social media, with a tweet can become a national headline. (+) Happy and vocal customers with clout on social media can advocate for a firm, for free or through sponsorship.</p>

<h3 id="bargainingpowerofsuppliers">Bargaining Power of Suppliers</h3>

<p>(+) Sites and platforms such as Alibaba and SalesForce allow for more choice and alternatives when a firm is selecting a supplier for a product or service that can increase fit and thus efficiency. (+) “Sharing Economy” has allowed for an alternative to some services, à la carte and in a reliable fashion; less overhead, more flexibility. (-) Suppliers, of both goods and services, can more easily go direct to market, bypassing the firm.</p>

<h3 id="threatofsubstitutes">Threat of Substitutes</h3>

<p>(-) Social/viral advertising allows for alternative products to gain consumer mind share more easily than before. (-) Mobile allows for substitute products to be found not just at home but from nearly anywhere, even in a firm’s retail location. (-) “Sharing economy” has allowed easy competition on the services side, creating alternatives that never existed before. (+) Social engagement and brand recognition can help buffer against new entrants, by forming a relationship with customers.</p>

<h3 id="industrycompetitors">Industry Competitors</h3>

<p>(-) Social engagement with customers is mandatory order to stay relevant and competitive to others in the industry. (-) Reduced competitive advantages in organizational systems as SaaS’s such as SalesForce continue to dominate the market. (+) Increased similarities in organizational systems can increase the ease of acquisitions.</p>

  <p>Many have argued that the Internet renders strategy obsolete. In reality, the opposite is true. Because the Internet tends to weaken industry profitability without providing proprietary operational advantages, it is more important than ever for companies to distinguish themselves through strategy. The winners will be those that view the Internet as a complement to, not a cannibal of, traditional ways of competing.</p>
