<h2 id="sourcingdecisioncycleframework">Sourcing Decision Cycle Framework</h2>

<ul>
<li>sourcing involves many decisions</li>
<li>first step is the make or buy decision</li>
<li>if choose to buy must decide where</li>
<li>if the company decides to go offshore, must decide if offshore company is near or far</li>
<li>periodic evaluation must take place</li>
<li>continual evaluation is needed to determine if the arrangement is satisfactory or not, for both outsourcing and insourcing</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="makeorbuy">Make or Buy?</h3>

<p>Does it involve a core competency? <br>
If outsourced: Loss of control over strategic initiatives; loss of strategic focus</p>

<p>Does it involve confidential or sensitive IS services or software development? <br>
If outsourced: Competitive secrets may be leaked</p>

<p>Is there enough time available to complete software development projects in-house? <br>
If insourced: Project not completed on time</p>

<p>Do the in-house IS professionals have adequate training, experience, or skills to provide the service or develop the software? <br>
If outsourced: Technological innovations limited to what provider offers; overreliance on provider’s skills</p>

<p>Are there reliable outsourcing providers who are likely to stay in business for the duration of the contract? <br>
If outsourced: Project not completed, or, if completed, project is over budget and late when another provider takes it over</p>

<p>Is there an outsourcing provider that has a culture and practices that are compatible with the client? <br>
If outsourced: Conflict between client and provider personnel </p>

<p>Are there economies of scale that make it cheaper to provide the service or develop the software in-house? <br>
If outsourced: Costs of project or operations becomes excessive because of the way, the contract is written</p>

<p>Does it offer a better ability to handle peaks? <br>
If insourced: Loss of business </p>

<p>Does it involve consolidating data centers? <br>

</ul>

<h4 id="avoidingoutsourcingrisks">Avoiding Outsourcing Risks</h4>

<ul>
<li>do not negotiate solely on price</li>
<li>craft full life cycle service contracts that occur in stages</li>
<li>establish short term contracts</li>
<li>use multiple best of breed suppliers</li>
<li>hone skills in contract management</li>

<li>use SOAs to increase agility</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fullversusselectiveoutsourcing">Full versus Selective Outsourcing</h4>

<ul>
<li>full outsourcing implies that an enterprise outsources all of its information system function from desktop services to software development</li>
<li>selective outsourcing or strategic outsourcing means an enterprise chooses which information technology capabilities to retain in house and which to give to an outsider</li>
<li>in a best of breed approach suppliers are chosen for their expertise in a specific technology area such as:
<ul><li>web site hosting</li>
<li>web 2.0</li>
<li>applications</li>
<li>business process application development</li>
<li>help desk support</li>
<li>networking and communications</li>
<li>social information technology services</li>
<li>data center operations</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>onshoring or inshoring is the performing outsourcing work domestically</li>
<li>onshoring may be considered the opposite of offshoring</li>
<li>rural sourcing, hiring outside providers with operations in rural parts of America, is a growing trend</li>
<li>lower salaries</li>
<li>lower living costs</li>
<li>closer time zones</li>
<li>similar culture</li>
<li>fewer hassles than dealing with foreign outsourcing providers</li>

<li>some countries offer a very well educated labor force</li>
<li>implementation of quantity standards
<ul><li>six sigma</li>
<li>ISO 9001</li></ul></li>
<li>offshoring can either be in a distant land
<ul><li>farshoring</li></ul></li>
<li>offshoring can be in relatively close proximity
<ul><li>nearshoring</li></ul></li>
<li>Farshoring is a form of offshoring that involves sourcing service work to a foreign, lower wage country that is far away in distance or time zone or both like India or China</li>
<li>Nearshoring is when work is sourced to a foreign, lower wage country that is relatively close in distance or time zone like Costa Rica</li>
<li>captive center is an overseas subsidiary that is set up to serve the parent company and operates like an outsourcing provider but is owned by the firm</li>
<li>captive center can be farshore or nearshore</li>

<h3 id="reevaluation">Reevaluation</h3>

<ul>
<li>status quo or change?</li>
<li>backsourcing means a company takes back in house assets activates and skills that were previously outsourced to one or more outside information system providers</li>
<li>companies backsource after terminating, renegotiating, or letting their contracts expire</li>
<li>the reasons given for backsourcing often mirror the reasons for outsourcing</li>
<li>outsourcing decisions can be difficult and expensive to revers requiring the company to acquire the necessary information technology infrastructure and staff</li>
