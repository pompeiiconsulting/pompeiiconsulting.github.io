<h2 id="sourcingdecisioncycleframework">Sourcing Decision Cycle Framework</h2>

<ul>
<li>sourcing involves many decisions</li>
<li>first step is the make or buy decision</li>
<li>if choose to buy must decide where</li>
<li>if the company decides to go offshore, must decide if offshore company is near or far</li>
<li>periodic evaluation must take place</li>
<li>continual evaluation is needed to determine if the arrangement is satisfactory or not, for both outsourcing and insourcing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="itsourcingdecisiontree">IT Sourcing Decision Tree</h3>

<h4 id="makeorbuy">Make or Buy?</h4>

<ul>
<li>insourcing</li>
<li><p>outsourcing</p>

<ul><li>offshoring</li>
<li>onshoring</li>

<li><p>evaluating status quo or change?</p>

<ul><li>backsourcing</li>
<li>stay</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="makeorbuy">Make or Buy?</h3>

<p>Does it involve a core competency? <br />
If outsourced: Loss of control over strategic initiatives; loss of strategic focus</p>

<p>Does it involve confidential or sensitive IS services or software development? <br />
If outsourced: Competitive secrets may be leaked</p>

<p>Is there enough time available to complete software development projects in-house? <br />
If insourced: Project not completed on time</p>

<p>Do the in-house IS professionals have adequate training, experience, or skills to provide the service or develop the software? <br />
If outsourced: Technological innovations limited to what provider offers; overreliance on provider’s skills</p>

<p>Are there reliable outsourcing providers who are likely to stay in business for the duration of the contract? <br />
If outsourced: Project not completed, or, if completed, project is over budget and late when another provider takes it over</p>

<p>Is there an outsourcing provider that has a culture and practices that are compatible with the client? <br />
If outsourced: Conflict between client and provider personnel </p>

<p>Are there economies of scale that make it cheaper to provide the service or develop the software in-house? <br />
If outsourced: Costs of project or operations becomes excessive because of the way, the contract is written</p>

<p>Does it offer a better ability to handle peaks? <br />
If insourced: Loss of business </p>

<p>Does it involve consolidating data centers? <br />
If insourced: Inefficient operations</p>

<h3 id="insourcing">Insourcing</h3>

<ul>
<li>a firm provides information system services or develops information systems in its own in house information systems organization</li>
<li>this is the make decision</li>
<li>drivers that favor this decision:
<ul><li>keep core competencies in house</li>
<li>information system services or products that require considerable security or confidentiality</li>
<li>time available in house to complete information system projects</li>
<li>in house information technology personnel</li></ul></li>
<li>challenges to insourcing
<ul><li>getting needed information technology resources from management</li>
<li>competent information technology staff available</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h3>

<ul>
<li>purchase of a good or service that was previously provided internally or that could be provided internally</li>
<li>driver that favor this decision:
<ul><li>cost reduction achieved through economies of scale (outsourcer may be able t negotiate lower prices on hardware and software)</li>
<li>help a company transition to new technologies through access to a larger information technology talent pool</li>
<li>brining in outside expertise can help management focus more on core activities rather than on information technology issues</li>
<li>outsourcing firms know how to hire, manage, and retain information technology staff</li>
<li>greater capacity on demand</li>
<li>overcome inertia to consolidate data centers</li>

<li>Easier to consolidate data centers</li>
<li>Provides a cash-infusion</li></ul></li>
<li>challenges to outsourcing
<ul><li>a degree of control is surrendered</li>
<li>lack of adequate anticipation of new techological capabilities when negotiating outsourcing contracts</li>
<li>company gives up any real potential to develop them for competitive advantage</li>
<li>contract terms may leave clients highly dependent on their providers</li>
<li>competitive secrets will be harder to keep</li>
<li>savings may never be realized</li>
<li>dealing with multiple outsourcing vendors</li>
<li>Maintains an adequate level of control</li>
<li>Maintains ability to respond to technological innovation</li>

<li>Ensures cost savings while protecting quality</li>
<li>Works effectively with suppliers</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="avoidingoutsourcingrisks">Avoiding Outsourcing Risks</h4>

<ul>
<li>do not negotiate solely on price</li>
<li>craft full life cycle service contracts that occur in stages</li>
<li>establish short term contracts</li>
<li>use multiple best of breed suppliers</li>
<li>hone skills in contract management</li>
<li>carefully evaluate your company's own capabilities</li>

<li>determine whether a particular outsourcing relationship produces a net benefit for your company</li>
<li>plan transition to outsourcing</li>
<li>use SOAs to increase agility</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fullversusselectiveoutsourcing">Full versus Selective Outsourcing</h4>

<ul>
<li>full outsourcing implies that an enterprise outsources all of its information system function from desktop services to software development</li>
<li>selective outsourcing or strategic outsourcing means an enterprise chooses which information technology capabilities to retain in house and which to give to an outsider</li>
<li>in a best of breed approach suppliers are chosen for their expertise in a specific technology area such as:
<ul><li>web site hosting</li>
<li>web 2.0</li>
<li>applications</li>
<li>business process application development</li>
<li>help desk support</li>
<li>networking and communications</li>
<li>social information technology services</li>
<li>data center operations</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="onshoring">Onshoring</h4>

<ul>
<li>onshoring or inshoring is the performing outsourcing work domestically</li>
<li>onshoring may be considered the opposite of offshoring</li>
<li>rural sourcing, hiring outside providers with operations in rural parts of America, is a growing trend</li>
<li>lower salaries</li>
<li>lower living costs</li>
<li>closer time zones</li>
<li>similar culture</li>
<li>fewer hassles than dealing with foreign outsourcing providers</li>
<li>too small to handle large scale projects</li>
<li>may not have the most technologically advanced employees</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="offshoring">Offshoring</h4>

<ul>
<li>the most general term for outsourcing abroad</li>
<li>sometimes short for offshore outsourcing</li>

<li>some countries offer a very well educated labor force</li>
<li>implementation of quantity standards
<ul><li>six sigma</li>
<li>ISO 9001</li></ul></li>
<li>offshoring can either be in a distant land
<ul><li>farshoring</li></ul></li>
<li>offshoring can be in relatively close proximity
<ul><li>nearshoring</li></ul></li>
<li>Farshoring is a form of offshoring that involves sourcing service work to a foreign, lower wage country that is far away in distance or time zone or both like India or China</li>
<li>Nearshoring is when work is sourced to a foreign, lower wage country that is relatively close in distance or time zone like Costa Rica</li>
<li>captive center is an overseas subsidiary that is set up to serve the parent company and operates like an outsourcing provider but is owned by the firm</li>
<li>captive center can be farshore or nearshore</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="offshoringdestinationselection">Offshoring Destination Selection</h5>

<ul>
<li>what makes countries attractive for offshoring?</li>
<li>high English language proficiency</li>
<li>countries that are politically stable</li>
<li>countries with lower crime rates</li>
<li>countries with friendly relationships</li>
<li>security and/or trade restrictions</li>

<li>SEI's capability maturity model (CMM)
<ul><li>levels 1-5</li>
<li>India has CMM level 5 software development processes</li>
<li>extremely reliable and desirable as vendors</li></ul></li>
<li>level of development of a country will determine if the location is appropriate</li>
<li>three tiers of software exporting nations</li>
<li>Tier 1
<ul><li>mature software exporting nations</li>

<li>not significantly impacting on the software industry</li>
<li>Cuba</li>
<li>Jordan</li></ul></li>
<li>cultural differences have to be carefully addressed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cloudcomputing">Cloud Computing</h3>

<ul>
<li>a third party provided information technology services over the internet</li>
<li>provides an entire data center's worth of servers, networking services, system management, security, storage, and other infrastructure</li>
<li>clients buy the exact amount of storage, computing power, security, or other information technology functions they need when they need it and pay only for what they use
<ul><li>possible cost savings</li></ul></li>
<li>24/7 access from multiple mobile devices</li>
<li>high availability for large backup data storage</li>
<li>ease of use</li>
</ul>

<li>designed to augment or replace the functions of an entire data center</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="platformasaservice">Platform as a Service</h4>

<ul>
<li>PaaS</li>
<li>provides services using virtualized servers on which clients can run existing applications or develop new ones without having to worry about maintaining the operating systems, server hardware, load balancing, or computing capacity</li>
<li>provider manages the hardware and underlying operating system</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="softwareasaservice">Software as a Service</h4>

<ul>
<li>SaaS</li>
<li>Application as a Service
<ul><li>ASP
software application functionality through a web browser  </li></ul></li>

<li>if the operating system or underlying service isn’t configured correctly the data at the higher application layer may be at risk</li>
<li>the most widely know and used form of cloud computing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reevaluation">Reevaluation</h3>

<ul>
<li>status quo or change?</li>
<li>backsourcing means a company takes back in house assets activates and skills that were previously outsourced to one or more outside information system providers</li>
<li>companies backsource after terminating, renegotiating, or letting their contracts expire</li>
<li>the reasons given for backsourcing often mirror the reasons for outsourcing</li>
<li>outsourcing decisions can be difficult and expensive to revers requiring the company to acquire the necessary information technology infrastructure and staff</li>
<li>backsourcing is followed by another cycle of decisions as the company responds to its dynamic environment</li>
