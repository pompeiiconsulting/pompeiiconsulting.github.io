<h2 id="sourcingdecisioncycleframework">Sourcing Decision Cycle Framework</h2>

<ul>
<li>sourcing involves many decisions</li>
<li>first step is the make or buy decision</li>
<li>if choose to buy must decide where</li>
<li>if the company decides to go offshore, must decide if offshore company is near or far</li>
<li>periodic evaluation must take place</li>
<li>continual evaluation is needed to determine if the arrangement is satisfactory or not, for both outsourcing and insourcing</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="makeorbuy">Make or Buy?</h3>

<p>Does it involve a core competency? <br>
If outsourced: Loss of control over strategic initiatives; loss of strategic focus</p>

<p>Does it involve confidential or sensitive IS services or software development? <br>
If outsourced: Competitive secrets may be leaked</p>

<p>Is there enough time available to complete software development projects in-house? <br>
If insourced: Project not completed on time</p>

<p>Do the in-house IS professionals have adequate training, experience, or skills to provide the service or develop the software? <br>
If outsourced: Technological innovations limited to what provider offers; overreliance on providerâ€™s skills</p>

<p>Are there reliable outsourcing providers who are likely to stay in business for the duration of the contract? <br>
If outsourced: Project not completed, or, if completed, project is over budget and late when another provider takes it over</p>

<p>Is there an outsourcing provider that has a culture and practices that are compatible with the client? <br>
If outsourced: Conflict between client and provider personnel </p>

<p>Are there economies of scale that make it cheaper to provide the service or develop the software in-house? <br>
If outsourced: Costs of project or operations becomes excessive because of the way, the contract is written</p>

<p>Does it offer a better ability to handle peaks? <br>
If insourced: Loss of business </p>

<p>Does it involve consolidating data centers? <br>

</ul>

<h4 id="avoidingoutsourcingrisks">Avoiding Outsourcing Risks</h4>

<ul>
<li>do not negotiate solely on price</li>
<li>craft full life cycle service contracts that occur in stages</li>
<li>establish short term contracts</li>
<li>use multiple best of breed suppliers</li>
<li>hone skills in contract management</li>

<li>use SOAs to increase agility</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fullversusselectiveoutsourcing">Full versus Selective Outsourcing</h4>

<ul>
<li>full outsourcing implies that an enterprise outsources all of its information system function from desktop services to software development</li>
<li>selective outsourcing or strategic outsourcing means an enterprise chooses which information technology capabilities to retain in house and which to give to an outsider</li>
<li>in a best of breed approach suppliers are chosen for their expertise in a specific technology area such as:
<ul><li>web site hosting</li>
<li>web 2.0</li>
<li>applications</li>
<li>business process application development</li>
<li>help desk support</li>
<li>networking and communications</li>
<li>social information technology services</li>
<li>data center operations</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="onshoring">Onshoring</h4>

<ul>
<li>onshoring or inshoring is the performing outsourcing work domestically</li>
<li>onshoring may be considered the opposite of offshoring</li>
<li>rural sourcing, hiring outside providers with operations in rural parts of America, is a growing trend</li>
<li>lower salaries</li>
<li>lower living costs</li>
<li>closer time zones</li>
<li>similar culture</li>
<li>fewer hassles than dealing with foreign outsourcing providers</li>

<li>some countries offer a very well educated labor force</li>
<li>implementation of quantity standards
<ul><li>six sigma</li>
<li>ISO 9001</li></ul></li>
<li>offshoring can either be in a distant land
<ul><li>farshoring</li></ul></li>
<li>offshoring can be in relatively close proximity
<ul><li>nearshoring</li></ul></li>
<li>Farshoring is a form of offshoring that involves sourcing service work to a foreign, lower wage country that is far away in distance or time zone or both like India or China</li>
<li>Nearshoring is when work is sourced to a foreign, lower wage country that is relatively close in distance or time zone like Costa Rica</li>
<li>captive center is an overseas subsidiary that is set up to serve the parent company and operates like an outsourcing provider but is owned by the firm</li>
<li>captive center can be farshore or nearshore</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>possible cost savings</li></ul></li>
<li>24/7 access from multiple mobile devices</li>
<li>high availability for large backup data storage</li>
<li>ease of use</li>
</ul>

<li>designed to augment or replace the functions of an entire data center</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="platformasaservice">Platform as a Service</h4>

<ul>
<li>PaaS</li>
<li>provides services using virtualized servers on which clients can run existing applications or develop new ones without having to worry about maintaining the operating systems, server hardware, load balancing, or computing capacity</li>
<li>provider manages the hardware and underlying operating system</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="reevaluation">Reevaluation</h3>

<ul>
<li>status quo or change?</li>
<li>backsourcing means a company takes back in house assets activates and skills that were previously outsourced to one or more outside information system providers</li>
<li>companies backsource after terminating, renegotiating, or letting their contracts expire</li>
<li>the reasons given for backsourcing often mirror the reasons for outsourcing</li>
<li>outsourcing decisions can be difficult and expensive to revers requiring the company to acquire the necessary information technology infrastructure and staff</li>
<li>backsourcing is followed by another cycle of decisions as the company responds to its dynamic environment</li>
